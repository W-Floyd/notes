# PPRX

## High level concepts

* Estimator
* Circular buffer
  * Where file device is read in
* Banks
  * Is a collection of the same type of channel
  * Associates itself with a buffer of type of datastream
  * Can be a bank of L1, or Gal.E1, or L1 but from second ant.
  * Single type, single antenna and frequency
  * Channels
    * Each channel is associated with everything that is needed for matched filter through decode data
    * FFT Acquisition
    * Code generator
    * Carrier generator
    * Symbol processor
    * Locking loops
      * FLL
      * DLL
      * PLL
    * Memory Manager
* Config Generator
