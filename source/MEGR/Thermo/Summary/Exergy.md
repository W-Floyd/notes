# Exergy

**Exergy** is the property that quantifies potential for use. The foregoing example illustrates that, unlike energy, exergy is not
conserved but is destroyed by irreversibilities.

## Definition

**Exergy** is the maximum theoretical work obtainable from an overall system consisting of a system and the environment as the system comes into equilibrium with the environment (passes to the dead state).

$$
\mathrm{E}=\left(U-U_{0}\right)+p_{0}\left(V-V_{0}\right)-T_{0}\left(S-S_{0}\right)+\mathrm{KE}+\mathrm{PE}
$$

### Specific Exergy

$$
\mathrm{e}=\left(u-u_{0}\right)+p_{0}\left(v-v_{0}\right)-T_{0}\left(s-s_{0}\right)+\mathrm{V}^{2} / 2+g z
$$

## Environment

The **environment** is regarded to be a simple compressible system that is large in extent and uniform in temperature, $T_{0},$ and pressure, $p_{0}$.

## Dead State

When a system of interest is at $T_{0}$ and $p_{0}$ and at rest relative to the environment, we say the system is at the **dead state**. At the dead state there can be no interaction between system and environment and, thus, no potential for developing work.
