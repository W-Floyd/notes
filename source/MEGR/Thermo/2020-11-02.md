## Example 20-1

A $4 \mathrm{kg}$ chunk of solid coal
$\left(c_{p}=1.26 \mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}\right)$ at
$100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is dropped in a small, well-insulated, tank
containing $10 \mathrm{kg}$ of liquid water at $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
The equilibrium temperature is measured to be about
$19.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine (a) change in stored exergy for the
combined system and (b) the amount of exergy destroyed in the process.
Take the surrounding temperature to be $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the
specific heat of water to be
$c_{p}=4.2 \mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}$

## Example 20-2

In a novel process that "cleanses" thermal energy of chaotic molecular
motion, which, in turn, provides for a more efficient heat engine cycle,
heat is transferred steadily from a hot thermal energy reservoir at
$T_{H}=1500 \mathrm{K}$ to a cold thermal energy reservoir at
$T_{L}=500 \mathrm{K}$ at a rate of $\dot{Q}=5 \mathrm{kW} .$ According
to the current thermodynamic model, what is the rate at which exergy is
destroyed in the thermodynamic universe. Assume the atmospheric
temperature surrounding this device to be $T_{0}=300 \mathrm{K}$

## Example 20-3

Let's now take our thermal energy cleansing process and retro fit a heat
engine to it. Heat steadily leaves a thermal energy reservoir at
$T_{H}=1500 \mathrm{K}$ at a rate of $\dot{Q}=5 \mathrm{kW}$ to produce
$2 \mathrm{kW}$ of useful power. The rest of the thermal energy is
rejected into the atmosphere, which is at temperature
$T_{0}=300 \mathrm{K}$, instead of a cold thermal energy reservoir.
Determine the rate at which exergy (a) enters and exits the heat engine.
