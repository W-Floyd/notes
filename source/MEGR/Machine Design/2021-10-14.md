# Nominal Bolt Sizes

See Tables 8-1, 8-2 (maybe just 8-1 repeated?).

# Bolt Specification

Check on canvas notes for this!

## English

Nominal Diameter - Threads/Inch - Length - Thread Series - Class Fit - Material Grade - Head Type

## Metric

Metrix - Nominal Diameter - Pitch - Material Class - Head Type

# How to size bolt and stuff

See 8-7

# Frustum

$\alpha \approx 30 \deg \mathrm{ for steels, cast iron, aluminum}$

# Washer diameter

Rule of thumb, if $\alpha =30$, $d_w = 1.5d$

Check canvas for $K_m$ equations

# Example 8-2

Good analysis of how to calculate spring constant of bolts and (???)

# Bolt tightness

$\underbrace{T}_{\text{Torque}} = \underbrace{K}_{\text{Friction coef}} \underbrace{F_i}_{\text{Initial Tension}} \underbrace{d}_{\text{Diameter}}$

$K = 0.2$ is a great approximation

$T = 0.2 F_i d$

# Proof Strength

Tables 8-9 to 8-11 give values for $S_p$

$$
S_p = 0.85 S_y
$$

ballpark!
