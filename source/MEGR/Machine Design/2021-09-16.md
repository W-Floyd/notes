# Design Factor vs. Safety Factor

$$
\begin{aligned}
    n_d &= \frac{\text{Loss of function parameter}}{\text{maximum allowable parameter}} = \frac{s_y}{\sigma}
\end{aligned}
$$

# Example

$\sigma_1=300$ and $\sigma_2=100$, $SF=2$, what tensilve strength $S_y$ is needed?

Assume third stress is $0$, so we can say overall circle is $\tau_\max\frac{300}{2}=150$

***

Safety factor is overall end result, design factor is input?
