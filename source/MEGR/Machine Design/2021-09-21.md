# Test 1

Combined loading problem.
Find all types of loads, find where they all happen, find where the combine greatest.
Please find/show/describe where this happens (red pen arrow/circle).

Singularity functions may be on test, but likely wont.

Textbook (hardcover), notesheet.

3 questions, partial credit is there.

Chapters 1-4, a lot of time in 3, some in 4, very little in 1-2.

To get credit, write some equations, FBD.

# Coulomb-Mohr Theory

$$
\frac{\sigma_1}{s_t} - \frac{\sigma_3}{s_c}=1
$$

# Ductile

Max shear stress - conservative

Distortion Energy Theory - $s_c = s_t$ - Good theory

Coulomb - Mohr Theory - $s_c \neq s_t$

# Brittle Material

Max Normal Stress Theory - Do not use this by option, it's not very accurate.

$s_u$ - Use ultimate strength

## Mohr Theory (for brittle materials)

If $s_{uc} \neq s_{ut}$

***

There is a flowchart for selecting.

# Fracture Mechanics

## Stress intensity factor

$$
k_\text{Stress Intensity} \neq k_\text{Stress Concentrations}
$$

How much stress is happening inside a crack growth problem.

$$
k_\text{Stress intensity} = \beta \sigma \sqrt{\pi a}
$$

$\beta$ is from charts.

Units of $k$ are $!_mpa \sqrt{!_m}$ or $!_ksi \sqrt{!_in}$

$k_c$ is critical stress intensity factor.

May modify with $k_{IC}$, which is the same for mode 1.
