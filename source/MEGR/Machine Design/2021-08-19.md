FEA is time consuming, aim is to find weakest point in design.

Example, cantilevered beam on wall - FEA isn't needed to tell us that it'll break at the wall.
This knowledge can help you limit scope to a more effective range.

It is our expertise that can take automated methods such as FEA and make them useful - our expertise cannot be automated.

# Shear

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \tau &= \frac{V}{A}\\
    \text{Where:}\\
    \tau &= \text{Shear Stress}\\
    V &= \text{Shear Load}\\
    A &= \text{Area}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Double Shear

You align forces.

$\epsilon$ denotes small distance, in our case the distance between the plates, making moments negligible.

$$
\tau = \frac{F}{(2\text{ Bolts})(\frac{2\text{ Areas}}{\text{Bolt}})}
$$

***

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_x &= \frac{My}{I}\\
    \text{Where:}\\
    y &= \text{Distance from neutral axis}\\
    I &= \text{Moment of inertia}
\end{aligned}
$$

$c$ is maximum $y$.

Might also see:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \sigma &= \frac{M}{Z}\\
    Z &= \frac{I}{c}\\
    \text{Where:}\\
    Z &= \text{Section Modulus}
\end{aligned}
$$

Suggestions is to use magnitude of stress and use intuition to figure out where it's going.

***

Neutral axis is along center of mass.
Helps with intuition.

# Moment of Inertia

## Solid Round Bar

$$
I = \frac{\pi d^4}{64}
$$

## Rectangular

$$
I = \frac{bh^3}{12}
$$

$$
\sigma_x = \frac{M_z y}{I_z} + \frac{M_y z}{I_y}
$$
