Pg. 315 has equation we need.

In the HW, write the equation once, but after that just write that you solved it using the calculator.

# Stress Concentration Factors

$k_t$ is the stress concentration factor.

$$
\sigma_{\max} = k_t \sigma_{\text{nominal}}
$$

Say for 1 inch diameter hole in 11 inch wide plate under 10000lb load:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_\text{nom} = \frac{P}{A} &= \frac{P}{\left(b-d\right)h} = \frac{10000}{(11-1)(1)}\\
    \sigma_\text{nom} &= 1000 !_psi
\end{aligned}
$$

Still use safety factors, these values can be off!

"Everything is a spring"

## Springs

We have parallel and series springs.

For parallel:

$$
k_\text{eq} = k_1 + k_2
$$

always getting stronger.

For series:

$$
\frac{1}{k_\text{eq}} = \frac{1}{k_1}+\frac{1}{k_2}
$$

always getting weaker.

## Spring Rate

$$
F = kx
$$

Tension or Compression

$$
\delta = \frac{Fl}{AE}
$$

$$
k = \frac{A\epsilon}{l}
$$
