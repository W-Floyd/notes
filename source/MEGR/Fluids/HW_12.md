# Homework 12 - Pipe Flow

## Problem 1
The piping system below discharges water at a rate of $0.27 \mathrm{m}^{3} / \mathrm{s}$. Both tanks are open to atmosphere and may be considered very large compared to the flow of water to or from the tanks. The total length of galvanized iron pipe is $1000 \mathrm{m}$ with an inner diameter of $40 \mathrm{cm}$. Determine the friction factor for the pipe. What pressure rise is required across the pump?

### Solution



## Problem 2
The piping system in a typical dwelling is shown in the figure below. The exit diameter of the faucet is $0.5 \mathrm{in}$. Determine the friction factor for all the $1\mathrm{-inch}$ pipe and for the $1 / 2$ inch pipe. The main pressure is $40 \mathrm{psig}$. Determine the flowrate through the pipe system. This will involve a trial and error solution. No need to do more than a few (2 or 3 ) iterations.

### Solution

## Problem 3
Water is pumped through a heat exchanger consisting of tubes $5 \mathrm{mm}$ in diameter and $5 \mathrm{m}$ long. The velocity in each tube is $0.1 \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$. The water temperature increases from $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at the entrance to $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at the exit. Calculate the pressure difference across the heat exchanger, neglecting entrance losses but accounting for the effect of temperature change.

### Solution

## Problem 4
A water distribution system is shown in the figure which has all pipe sections are smooth wall PVC with a $1\mathrm{-inch}$ inner diameter. The pressure at $1$ is $60 \mathrm{psig}$, and the discharges at $3$ and $4$ are through sprinkler heads to ambient pressure at $0 \mathrm{psig}$. The two sprinkler heads have loss coefficients given by:
$$
\frac{\Delta p}{\rho}=K_{\text {sprinkler }} \frac{V^{2}}{2}
$$

With the value of $K_{\text {sprinkler }}=5$.

a. Write sufficient equations to solve for the flow at each branch through the sprinklers at 3 and 4.
b. Determine the flow of water through each branch of the system. Use the following properties for the water: $\rho=1.94$ slug $/ \mathrm{ft}^{3}, \mu=2.34 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{lb} \cdot \mathrm{sec} / \mathrm{ft}^{2}, \mathrm{v}=1.21 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{ft}^{2} / \mathrm{sec}$.

The pipe system lays in horizontal plane. No gravity head.
