2 part lab, 1.5 labs worth of setup and report.

As air is passing from left to right, we have shear stresses.

Next, we have pressure from the air acting on the airfoil.

We can use integrals to find the force over the wing:

$$
F_L = \int{\left( P \text{ in } \vec{j} \right) + \left( \tau \vec{j} \right) }dA
$$

$$
F_D = \int{\left( P \text{ in } \vec{i} \right) + \left( \tau \vec{i} \right) }dA
$$

2 methods of finding coefficients - one using pressure ports, and another using lift and drag directly.

$$
F_L = C_L \frac{A_L \rho}{2} V_o^2
$$

$$
F_D = C_D \frac{A_D \rho}{2} V_o^2
$$

$$
A_L \not = A_L
$$

# Outline for next two weeks

M->F

Lift/Drag using strain gauges - he will provide the VI.

Hint - was there an area that we really need to measure before calculating?
I need the: cross sectional area (height/width), specific type of wing.

Wednesday lecture may be lab.

M->F

Measure using pressure ports.
Also no VI.

Wednesday may be in computer lab (MATLAB)

Writeup will be comparing the the values found from both measurement methods.
