$$
V^{2}=\frac{2\left(p_{t}-p_{s}\right)}{\rho}
$$

therefore:

$$
V=\sqrt{\frac{2\left(\Delta p\right)}{\rho}}
$$

The density of air at the time of experiment was calculated to be $1.17732 \mathrm{~kg}/mathrm{m}^3$

Using computer software, each pressure differential reading was used to calculate the velocity it corresponded to.

A linear line of best fit can be plotted also.

The result of this relationship, when plotted against Fan Frequency is as follows:
