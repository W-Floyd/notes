# Lab Info

Lab this week: Just come in

Next week: Tensile Testing

We will have the same setup as ME Lab 1,

* Intro
* Setup/Procedure
* Analysis
* Extensions

# Tensile Testing

## Properties of Materials

* Modulus of elasticity
* Yield strength
* Critical stress
* Elastic/Plastic deformation
* Resiliency
  * We'll do hardness testing in lab
* Thermal conductivity
* Strain
* Toughness

## Key Equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma &= E \epsilon\\
\epsilon &= \frac{l-l_0}{l_0}\\
\sigma &= \frac{P}{A}\\
\text{where:}\\
P &= \text{Force}\\
A &= \text{Area of Cross Section}\\
l &= \text{Length of Part}\\
l_0 &= \text{Original Length of Part}
\end{aligned}
$$

Limitation is small imperfections that cause premature failure.

## Theory

We will spend a lot of our focus and time in the linear region.

We are going to do regressions in just about every lab we're going to do.
Suggestions is to use Excel.

### Regression
A regression is a statistical analysis that attempts to match the line with as many data points as possible.

### Interpolation
Interpolation is finding the data between other points.

### Extrapolation
Extrapolation is using known trends to find a further value than is known.

### True Strain

Accounts for the stress as it truly is in the part, according to the cross-sectional area, not as measured by the machine.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \epsilon_T = \ln{R} &= \ln{1+\epsilon}\\
    &= \ln{\frac{l}{l_0}}\\
    R &= 1+ \epsilon\\
    \text{Recall: } \epsilon &= \frac{l-l_0}{l}\\
    \sigma_T &= \frac{P}{A}\left(1+\epsilon\right)\\
\end{aligned}
$$
