Consider a large plane wall of thickness $L=0.3 \mathrm{~m}$, thermal conductivity $k=2.5 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}$, and surface area $A= 12 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The left side of the wall at $x=0$ is subjected to a net heat flux of $\dot{q}_{0}=700 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ while the temperature at that surface is measured to be $T_{1}=80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Assuming constant thermal conductivity and no heat generation in the wall,

a. express the differential equation and the boundary conditions for steady one-dimensional heat conduction through the wall,
b. obtain a relation for the variation of temperature in the wall by solving the differential equation, and
c. evaluate the temperature of the right surface of the wall at $x=L$.

Answer: c) $-4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
