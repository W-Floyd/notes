Consider a large plane wall of thickness $L=0.4 \mathrm{~m}$ thermal conductivity $k=1.8 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}$, and surface area $A= 30 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The left side of the wall is maintained at a constant temperature of $T_{1}=90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ while the right side loses heat by convection to the surrounding air at $T_{\infty}=25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with a heat transfer coefficient of $h=24 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. Assuming constant thermal conductivity and no heat generation in the wall,

a. express the differential equation and the boundary conditions for steady one-dimensional heat conduction through the wall,
b. obtain a relation for the variation of temperature in the wall by solving the differential equation, and
c. evaluate the rate of heat transfer through the wall.
