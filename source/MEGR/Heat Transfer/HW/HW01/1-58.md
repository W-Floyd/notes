In a certain experiment, cylindrical samples of diameter $4 \mathrm{~cm}$ and length $7 \mathrm{~cm}$ are used. The two thermocouples in each sample are placed $3 \mathrm{~cm}$ apart. After initial transients, the electric heater is observed to draw 0.6 A at $110 \mathrm{~V},$ and both differential thermometers read a temperature difference of $8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine the thermal conductivity of the sample. Answer: $98.5 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}$
