The inner and outer surfaces of a $25\mathrm{~cm}$ thick wall in summer are at $27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $44^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, respectively. The outer surface of the wall exchanges heat by radiation with surrounding surfaces at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C},$ and convection with ambient air also at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with a convection heat transfer coefficient of $8 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. Solar radiation is incident on the surface at a rate of $150 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. If both the emissivity and the solar absorptivity of the outer surface are $0.8$, determine the effective thermal conductivity of the wall.
