Consider a steel pan used to boil water on top of an electric range. The
bottom section of the pan is $L=0.3 \mathrm{~cm}$ thick and has a
diameter of $D=20 \mathrm{~cm}$. The electric heating unit on the range
top consumes $1250 \mathrm{~W}$ of power during cooking, and 85 percent
of the heat generated in the heating element is transferred uniformly to
the pan. Heat transfer from the top surface of the bottom section to the
water is by convection with a heat transfer coefficient of $h$. Assuming
constant thermal conductivity and one-dimensional heat transfer, express
the mathematical formulation (the differential equation and the boundary
conditions) of this heat conduction problem during steady operation. Do
not solve.

# Solution

## Assumptions

-   The system is at steady state
-   Heat conduction is constant

## Working

Power transferred to the pan is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \dot{Q}_\mathrm{pot} &= 1250 \cdot 0.85 \\
    \dot{Q}_\mathrm{pot} &= 1062.5 \mathrm{~W}
\end{aligned}
$$

The area of the bottom of the pan is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A &= \pi \left( \frac{20}{2} \right)^2\\
      &= \pi \cdot 100 \mathrm{~cm}^2\\
    A &= \frac{\pi}{100} \mathrm{~m}^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus the heat flux through the bottom of the pan is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\dot{Q}}{A} &= \frac{1062.5}{\frac{\pi}{100}}\\
    &= \frac{100 \cdot 1062.5}{\pi}\\
    &= \frac{106250}{\pi}\\
    \frac{\dot{Q}}{A} &= 33820.4 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

We know the following to be true for constant thermal conductivity:

$$
\vec{\nabla} \cdot(k \vec{\nabla} T)+\dot{e}_{g}=\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

which for this one-dimensional scenario becomes:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x})+\dot{e}_{g}=\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

However, due to steady state, lack of heat generation, and constant
conduction coefficient:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x})+\cancelto{0}{\dot{e}_{g}}&=\rho c \cancelto{0}{\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}}\\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x})&=0\\
    k \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} &= 0\\
    \Aboxed{\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}&=0}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

We can also determine an equation related to the heat flux on the bottom
of the pot:

$$
\frac{\vec{\dot{Q}}_{x}}{A_{c}}=-k \vec{\nabla} T=-k\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\right)=-k \frac{\partial T}{\partial n} \hat{n}
$$

which for our single dimension, will yield:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{{\dot{Q}}_{x}}{A_{c}}&=-k \frac{\partial T\left( 0 \right)}{\partial x}\\
    \therefore \frac{{\dot{Q}}_{x}}{A_{c}} = \Aboxed{-k \frac{\partial T\left( 0 \right)}{\partial x}&=33820.4 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, for the convection of the water to the inside of the pot we
know the following:

$$
\dot{Q}_{\mathrm{conv}}=h A_{s}\left(T_{s}-T_{\infty}\right)
$$

which may be rearranged to form:

$$
\frac{\dot{Q}_{\mathrm{conv}}}{A_{s}}=h \left(T_{s}-T_{\infty}\right)
$$

Combining this with prior equations yields:

$$
\boxed{-k \frac{\partial T(L)}{\partial x}=h \left(T(L)-T_{\infty}\right)}
$$

Thus, the final set of equations is:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}&=0\\
    -k \frac{\partial T\left( 0 \right)}{\partial x}&=33820.4 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2}\\
    -k \frac{\partial T(L)}{\partial x}&=h \left(T(L)-T_{\infty}\right)
\end{aligned}
}
$$
