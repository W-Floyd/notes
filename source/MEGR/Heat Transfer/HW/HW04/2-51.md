A spherical metal ball of radius $r_{o}$ is heated in an oven to a temperature of $T_{i}$ throughout and is then taken out of the oven and dropped into a large body of water at $T_{\infty}$ where it is cooled by convection with an average convection heat transfer coefficient of $h$. Assuming constant thermal conductivity and transient one-dimensional heat transfer, express the mathematical formulation (the differential equation and the boundary and initial conditions) of this heat conduction problem. Do not solve.

# Solution

The differential equation may be found using the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(k r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin ^{2}(\theta)} \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\left(k \frac{\partial T}{\partial \phi}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin (\theta)} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(k \sin (\theta) \frac{\partial T}{\partial \theta}\right)+\dot{e}_{g}&=\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\\
\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(k r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)+\cancelto{0}{\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin ^{2}(\theta)} \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\left(k \frac{\partial T}{\partial \phi}\right)}+\cancelto{0}{\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin (\theta)} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(k \sin (\theta) \frac{\partial T}{\partial \theta}\right)}+\cancelto{0}{\dot{e}_{g}}&=\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\\
\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(k r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)&=\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\\
\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)&=\frac{\rho c}{k} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\\
!Aboxed{\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left( r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)}{=}{\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

When first dropped ($t=0$), for any radius $r$ within the ball:

$$
\boxed{T(r,0) = T_i}
$$

Due to the symmetry about the center of the ball, the temperature gradient at the center will be $0$ at all times:

$$
\boxed{\frac{\partial T(0,t)}{\partial r} = 0}
$$

The convection will cause the following to occur on the outer surface ($R_O$) of the ball.
Using the following equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\dot{Q}}{A} &= h \left( T_s - T_\infty \right)\\
\dot{Q} &= -k A \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}
\end{aligned}
$$

we can say:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    h \left( T_s - T_\infty \right) &= -k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}
\end{aligned}
$$

that is:

$$
\boxed{
    h \left( T(r_O,t) - T_\infty \right) = -k \frac{\partial T(r_0,t)}{\partial x}
}
$$

Thus, the final set of equations is:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
    T(r,0) &= T_i\\
    \frac{\partial T(0,t)}{\partial r} &= 0\\
    h \left( T(r_O,t) - T_\infty \right) &= -k \frac{\partial T(r_0,t)}{\partial x}
\end{aligned}
}
$$
