Water flows through a pipe at an average temperature of
$T_{\infty}=90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The inner and outer radii of the
pipe are $r_{1}=$ $6 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $r_{2}=6.5 \mathrm{~cm},$
respectively. The outer surface of the pipe is wrapped with a thin
electric heater that consumes $400 \mathrm{~W}$ per $\mathrm{m}$ length
of the pipe. The exposed surface of the heater is heavily insulated so
that the entire heat generated in the heater is transferred to the pipe.
Heat is transferred from the inner surface of the pipe to the water by
convection with a heat transfer coefficient of
$h=85 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. Assuming constant
thermal conductivity and one-dimensional heat transfer, express the
mathematical formulation (the differential equation and the boundary
conditions) of the heat conduction in the pipe during steady operation.
Do not solve.

# Solution

## Assumptions

-   One-dimensional heat transfer in direction of radius
-   Constant heat transfer coefficients
-   No heat generation internally
-   Heat flux on the outside of the pipe is uniform
-   Convection on the inside of the pipe is uniform
-   Steady state

## Working

Heat flux due to the insulated heater may be calculated:

$$
\frac{\dot{Q}}{A} = \frac{400}{1 \cdot \pi \cdot \frac{6.5}{100} \cdot 2 } = 979.415 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2}
$$

We know for cylindrical coordinates:

$$
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(k r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\theta}{\partial \phi}\left(k \frac{\partial T}{\partial \phi}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(k \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\right)+\dot{e}_{g}=\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

which for our single dimensions becomes:

$$
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(k r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)+\dot{e}_{g}=\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

given steady state and no heat generation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(k r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)+\cancelto{0}{\dot{e}_{g}}&=\cancelto{0}{\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}}\\
    \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(k r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)&=0\\
    \Aboxed{\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left( r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)&=0}
\end{aligned}
$$

The heat flux through the surfaces of the pipe:

$$
\dot{Q}_{\mathrm{cond}}=-k A_{c} \frac{d T}{d x}
$$

which may be rearranged and substituted to find the outer heat flux:

$$
\boxed{-k \frac{d T(r_2)}{d r} = 979.415 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2}}
$$

For the convection on the inside of the pipe:

$$
\dot{Q}_{\mathrm{conv}}=h A_{s}\left(T_{s}-T_{\infty}\right)
$$

which may be rearranged to form:

$$
\frac{\dot{Q}_{\mathrm{conv}}}{A_{s}}=h \left(T_{s}-T_{\infty}\right)
$$

which similarly produces:

$$
\boxed{-k \frac{d T(r_1)}{d r} = 85 \left(T(r)-90\right)}
$$

Thus, the final set of equations is:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left( r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)&=0\\
    -k \frac{d T(r_2)}{d r} &= 979.415 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2}\\
    -k \frac{d T(r_1)}{d r} &= 85 \left(T(r)-90\right)
\end{aligned}
}
$$
