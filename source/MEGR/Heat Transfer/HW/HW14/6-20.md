A metal plate $k=180 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}, \rho=2800 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$, and $c_{p}=880 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ with a thickness of $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ is being cooled by air at $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with a convection heat transfer coefficient of $30 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. If the initial temperature of the plate is $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, determine the plate temperature gradient at the surface after 2 minutes of cooling. Hint: Use the lumped system analysis to calculate the plate surface temperature. Make sure to verify the application of this method to this problem.

# Solution

Use characteristic length to check Biot number, use lumped system if possible to find the temperature, then find the gradient from that.
