Consider a medium in which the heat conduction equation is given in its simplest form as:

$$
\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)=\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

a. Is heat transfer steady or transient?
b. Is heat transfer one-, two-, or three-dimensional?
c. Is there heat generation in the medium?
d. Is the thermal conductivity of the medium constant or variable?

# Answer

a. Unsteady
b. 1 dimensional
c. No heat generation
d. Constant
