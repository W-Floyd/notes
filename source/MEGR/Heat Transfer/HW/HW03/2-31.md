Consider a medium in which the heat conduction equation is given in its
simplest form as:

$$
\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta} \frac{\partial^{2} T}{\partial \phi^{2}}=\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

a.  Is heat transfer steady or transient?
b.  Is heat transfer one-, two-, or three-dimensional?
c.  Is there heat generation in the medium?
d.  Is the thermal conductivity of the medium constant or variable?

# Answer

a.  Transient
b.  2 dimensional
c.  No heat generation
d.  Constant
