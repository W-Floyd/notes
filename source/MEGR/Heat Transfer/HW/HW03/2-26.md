Consider a medium in which the heat conduction equation is given in its simplest form as:

$$
\frac{\partial^{2} T}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} T}{\partial y^{2}}=\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

a. Is heat transfer steady or transient?
b. Is heat transfer one-, two-, or three-dimensional?
c. Is there heat generation in the medium?
d. Is the thermal conductivity of the medium constant or variable?

# Answer

a. The heat transfer is transient.
b. 2 Dimensional
c. No heat generation.
d. Constant thermal conductivity.
