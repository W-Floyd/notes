Consider a medium in which the heat conduction equation is given in its simplest form as:

$$
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(k r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(k \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\right)+\dot{e}_{\mathrm{gen}}=0
$$

a. Is heat transfer steady or transient?
b. Is heat transfer one-, two-, or three-dimensional?
c. Is there heat generation in the medium?
d. Is the thermal conductivity of the medium constant or variable?

# Answer

a. The heat transfer is steady.
b. The heat transfer is two dimensional.
c. There is heat generation.
d. The thermal conductivity is variable.
