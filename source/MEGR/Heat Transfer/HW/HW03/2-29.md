Consider a medium in which the heat conduction equation is given in its simplest form as:

$$
r \frac{d^{2} T}{d r^{2}}+2 \frac{d T}{d r}=0
$$

a. Is heat transfer steady or transient?
b. Is heat transfer one-, two-, or three-dimensional?
c. Is there heat generation in the medium?
d. Is the thermal conductivity of the medium constant or variable?

# Answer

a. Steady
b. 1 dimensional
c. No heat generation
d. Constant thermal conductivity
