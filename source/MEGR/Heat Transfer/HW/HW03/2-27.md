Consider a medium in which the heat conduction equation is given in its simplest form as:

$$
\frac{1}{r} \frac{d}{d r}\left(r k \frac{d T}{d r}\right)+\dot{e}_{\mathrm{gen}}=0
$$

a. Is heat transfer steady or transient?
b. Is heat transfer one-, two-, or three-dimensional?
c. Is there heat generation in the medium?
d. Is the thermal conductivity of the medium constant or variable?

# Answer

a. The heat transfer is steady.
b. It is one-dimensional.
c. There is heat generation present.
d. The thermal conductivity is variable.
