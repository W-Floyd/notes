Consider a 150-W incandescent lamp.
The filament of the lamp is $5 \mathrm{cm}$ long and has a diameter of $0.5 \mathrm{~mm} .$ The diameter of the glass bulb of the lamp is $8 \mathrm{~cm} .$ Determine the heat flux, in $\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$,

b. on the surface of the glass bulb
c. calculate how much it will cost per year to keep that lamp on for eight hours a day every day if the unit cost of electricity is $\$ 0.08 / \mathrm{kWh}$.

# Solution

Heat flux is denoted by $\dot{q}$, and may be defined as:

$$
\dot{q} = \frac{P}{A}
$$

Assuming the bulb is at steady state, the average heat flux of each surface the heat passes through may be calculated as shown above, using $P=150\mathrm{W}$.

a.  The surface area of the filament must be found.

Assuming the surface area to be that of a cyclinder:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A &= \pi d  L \\
    &= \pi \cdot 0.5 \mathrm{mm} \cdot 5 \mathrm{cm}\\
    A &= 7.854 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{m}^2
\end{aligned}
$$

the heat flux may then be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \dot{q} &= \frac{150}{7.854 \times 10^{-5}} \frac{W}{\mathrm{m}^2}\\
    \dot{q} &= 1.910 \times 10^6 \frac{W}{\mathrm{m}^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

b.  Similarly, the surface area of the bulb must be found.

Assuming the surface area of the bulb to that of a sphere:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A &= 4 \pi r^2 = \pi D^2 \\
    &= \pi \cdot \left( 8 \mathrm{cm} \right)^2\\
    A &= 0.0201 \mathrm{m}^2
\end{aligned}
$$

the heat flux may then be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \dot{q} &= \frac{150}{0.0201} \frac{W}{\mathrm{m}^2}\\
    \dot{q} &= 7.460 \times 10^3 \frac{W}{\mathrm{m}^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

c.  Cost may be calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Yearly Cost} &= 150 \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{1000} \cdot 365 \cdot 0.08 \\
    &= \$35.04
\end{aligned}
$$
