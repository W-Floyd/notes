Consider a large $5-\mathrm{cm}$-thick brass plate ($k=111 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}$) in which heat is generated uniformly at a rate of $2 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. One side of the plate is insulated while the other side is exposed to an environment at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with a heat transfer coefficient of $44 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. Explain where in the plate the highest and the lowest temperatures will occur, and determine their values.
