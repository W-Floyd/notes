$2-99$ A long homogeneous resistance wire of radius $r_{o}= 5 \mathrm{~mm}$ is being used to heat the air in a room by the passage of electric current. Heat is generated in the wire uniformly at a rate of $5 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ as a result of resistance heating. If the temperature of the outer surface of the wire remains at $180^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, determine the temperature at $r=3.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ after steady operation conditions are reached. Take the thermal conductivity of the wire to be $k=6 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}$.

Answer: $207^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
