Consider a large plate of thickness $L$ and thermal conductivity $k$ in which heat is generated uniformly at a rate of $\dot{e}_{\mathrm{gen}}$. One side of the plate is insulated while the other side is exposed to an environment at $T_{\infty}$ with a heat transfer coefficient of $h$

a. Express the differential equation and the boundary conditions for steady one-dimensional heat conduction through the plate
b. determine the variation of temperature in the plate, and
c. obtain relations for the temperatures on both surfaces and the maximum temperature rise in the plate in terms of given parameters.
