Consider a water pipe of length $L=17 \mathrm{~m}$, inner radius $r_{1}=15 \mathrm{~cm},$ outer radius $r_{2}=20 \mathrm{~cm}$, and thermal conductivity $k=14 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. Heat is generated in the pipe material uniformly by a $25-\mathrm{kW}$ electric resistance heater. The inner and outer surfaces of the pipe are at $T_{1}=60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $T_{2}=80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, respectively. Obtain a general relation for temperature distribution inside the pipe under steady conditions and determine the temperature at the center plane of the pipe.
