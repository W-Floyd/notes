In an experiment to measure convection heat transfer coefficients, a
very thin metal foil of very low emissivity (e.g., highly polished
copper) is attached on the surface of a slab of material with very low
thermal conductivity. The other surface of the metal foil is exposed to
convection heat transfer by flowing fluid over the foil surface. This
setup diminishes heat conduction through the slab and radiation on the
metal foil surface, while heat convection plays the prominent role. The
slab on which the metal foil is attached to has a thickness of
$25 \mathrm{~mm}$ and a thermal conductivity of
$0.023 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. In a condition where
the surrounding room temperature is $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the metal
foil is heated electrically with a uniform heat flux of
$5000 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. If the bottom surface of the slab
is $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the metal foil has an emissivity of
$0.02$, determine:

a.  the convection heat transfer coefficient if air is flowing over the
    metal foil and the surface temperature of the foil is
    $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; and
b.  the convection heat transfer coefficient if water is flowing over
    the metal foil and the surface temperature of the foil is
    $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

# Solution

We may find the radiation heat transfer coefficient using:

$$
h_{\mathrm{rad}} \equiv \varepsilon \sigma\left(T_{\mathrm{s}}+T_{\mathrm{surr}}\right)\left(T_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}+T_{\mathrm{surr}}^{2}\right)
$$
