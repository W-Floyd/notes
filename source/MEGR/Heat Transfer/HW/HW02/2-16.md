Consider a large $3\mathrm{~cm}$ thick stainless steel plate in which heat is generated uniformly at a rate of $5 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. Assuming the plate is losing heat from both sides, determine the heat flux on the surface of the plate during steady operation.

# Solution

We know:

$$
\frac{\dot{Q}}{A} = k \frac{dT}{dx}
$$

Given the thickness of the plate, we can find the heat generation per unit area:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\dot{Q}}{A} &= \frac{\dot{Q}}{\mathbb{V}}\cdot x\\
&= 5 \times 10^6 \cdot 0.03\\
&= 150000 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The heat flux on each side will be half of this:

$$
\boxed{\frac{\dot{Q}}{A} = 75000 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2}}
$$
