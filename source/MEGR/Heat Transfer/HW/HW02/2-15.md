Heat flux meters use a very sensitive device known as a thermopile to
measure the temperature difference across a thin, heat conducting film
made of kapton $(k=0.345 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K})$. If
the thermopile can detect temperature differences of
$0.1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or more and the film thickness is
$2 \mathrm{~mm}$, what is the minimum heat flux this meter can detect?

# Solution

We know:

$$
\frac{\dot{Q}}{A} = k \frac{dT}{dx}
$$

Thus heat flux can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\dot{Q}}{A} &= 0.345 \cdot \frac{0.1}{0.002}\\
\Aboxed{\frac{\dot{Q}}{A}&=17.25\frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2}}
\end{aligned}
$$
