$1.2\mathrm{~kg}$ of liquid water initially at $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is to be heated to $95^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a teapot equipped with a $1200\mathrm{W}$ electric heating element inside. The teapot is $0.5 \mathrm{~kg}$ and has an average specific heat of $0.7 \frac{\mathrm{~kJ}}{ \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}}$. Taking the specific heat of water to be $4.18 \frac{\mathrm{~kJ}}{\mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}}$ and disregarding any heat loss from the teapot, determine how long it will take for the water to be heated.

# Solution

## Assumptions

* no heat losses
* specific heats are constant

## Working

Specific heat is the heat energy required to raise the temperature of a set mass of substance a set amount.
Given a temperature change, and a mass, we may find heat energy required.
Given power, we may then find time required.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P &= \frac{W}{t}\\
\therefore t &= \frac{W}{P}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
c &= \frac{W}{m \cdot \Delta T}\\
\therefore W &= c \cdot m \cdot \Delta T\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus:

$$
\begin{aligned}
t &= \frac{c \cdot m \cdot \Delta T}{P}\\
&= \frac{\left( 700 \cdot 0.5 + 4180 \cdot 1.2 \right) \cdot \left( 95 - 15 \right)}{1200}\\
t &= 357.733 \mathrm{~seconds}\\
!Aboxed{t}{=}{5.96 \mathrm{~minutes}}
\end{aligned}
$$
