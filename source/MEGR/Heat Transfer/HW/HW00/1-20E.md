A 60 -gallon water heater is initially filled with water at
$50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Determine how much energy (in $\mathrm{Btu}$)
needs to be transferred to the water to raise its temperature to
$120^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Evaluate the water properties at an average
water temperature of $85^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

# Solution

Because we are told to evaluate at an average temperature of
$85^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, and the system has a constant volume, we can
use the equation for a stationary closed system:

$$
Q=m c_{v} \Delta T
$$

We assume constant pressure also.

From table A-9E, the density may be interpolated between
$80$-$90^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho &= \frac{62.22 + 62.12}{2} \frac{\mathrm{lbm}}{\mathrm{ft}^{3}}\\
&= 62.17 \frac{\mathrm{lbm}}{\mathrm{ft}^{3}}
\end{aligned}
$$

and hence the mass may be found:

$$
\begin{aligned}
m &= \rho \cdot V\\
&= 62.17 \frac{\mathrm{lbm}}{\mathrm{ft}^{3}} \cdot 60 \mathrm{gal}\\
m &= 498.655 \mathrm{lb}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because of the assumption of constant pressure, $c_p$ may be used in
place of $c_v$. From table A-9E it is found that
$c_p = 0.999 \frac{\mathrm{Btu}}{\mathrm{lbm}\cdot\mathrm{R}}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q &= 498.655 \mathrm{lbm} \cdot 0.999 \frac{\mathrm{Btu}}{\mathrm{lbm}\cdot\mathrm{R}} \cdot \left( 120 - 50 \right) \mathrm{R}\\
\Aboxed{Q&=34871 \mathrm{Btu}}
\end{aligned}
$$
