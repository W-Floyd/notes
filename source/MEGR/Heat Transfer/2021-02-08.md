# Solving Heat Transfer Problems (By Means of Differential Equations)

## Worked Example 1

Consider the base plate of an $800 \mathrm{~W}$ household iron with a thickness $L=0.6 \mathrm{~cm}$ base area of $A=160 \mathrm{~cm}^{2},$ and a thermal conductivity of $k=60 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K} .$ The
inner surface of the base plate is subjected to a uniform heat flux generated by the resistance heater inside. When steady operating conditions are reached, the
outer surface temperature of the plate is measured to be $112{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Disregarding any
heat loss through the upper part of the iron,

a. express the differential equation
and the boundary conditions
b. obtain a relation for the temperature distribution
through the plate
c. evaluate the inner surface temperature of the plate.

### Solution

Flux is one dimensional, constant $k$, steady, no internal energy generation, no stray heat loss.

Want to find $T$ of $x$.

Start with our big heat diffusion equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cancel{k} \frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial x^2} = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Second order differential equation.
Need two boundary conditions.

#### Condition 1

Boundary condition of the first kind (Dirichlet):

$$
T(x=L)=T_0
$$

#### Condition 2

Boundary condition

$$
\left. \frac{\dot{Q}}{A_s} \right|_\text{Flux} = \frac{\dot{Q}_\text{cond}}{A_c}=-k \frac{dT}{dx}
$$

That is:

$$
\left. \frac{dT}{dx} \right|_{x=0} = - \frac{1}{k}\frac{\dot{Q}}{A_s}
$$

***

The answer to a. then is:

$$
\left.
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} &= 0 \\
T(x=L) &= T_0\\
\left. \frac{dT}{dx} \right|_{x=0} = -\frac{1}{k} \frac{\dot{Q}}{A_s}
\end{aligned}
\right\}
$$

***The following isn't technically correct, but it can be helpful to think of it this way***:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right) &= 0\\
\partial \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right) = 0 \partial x\\
\int{\partial \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right)} &= 0\int{\partial x}\\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} &= c_1\\
\int{\partial T} &= c_1 \int{\partial x}\\
T &= c_1 x + c_2
\end{aligned}
$$

So now we have an equation for $T$ in terms of $x$ with two unknowns.
This is the hidden reason we need two constrains on the system.

Start by looking if there is any $0$ that you could use to find values.
Let's start with our last equation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left. \frac{dT}{dx} \right|_{x=0} = c_1 &= -\frac{1}{k} \frac{\dot{Q}}{A_s}\\
&= - \frac{1}{60 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}}} \frac{800 \mathrm{~W}}{160 \mathrm{~cm}^2}\\
!Aboxed{c_1}{\approx}{-833 \frac{\mathrm{K}}{\mathrm{m}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Next, we can solve:

$$
\begin{aligned}
T(x=L) &= \left(-833 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}}\right)\left(0.006\mathrm{m}\right)+c_2\\
&= 385 \mathrm{K}\\
\therefore c_2 &= 385 \mathrm{K} + 5\mathrm{K}\\
&= 390 \mathrm{K}\\
!Aboxed{c_2}{=}{117^\circ \mathrm{C}}
\end{aligned}
$$

(Just showing how didn't need to change to Kelvin).

Now for b.:

$$
\boxed{
T(x) = -833x + 117
}
$$

\newpage

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_\mathrm{K} &= T_\mathrm{C} + 273\\
T_\mathrm{C} &= T_\mathrm{K} - 273
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_\mathrm{K} &= T_\mathrm{C} + 273\\
T_\mathrm{C} &= T_\mathrm{K} - 273\\
\therefore T_\mathrm{K} &= \left(T_\mathrm{K}-273\right) + 273
\end{aligned}
$$
