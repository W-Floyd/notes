## Question 1

Reduce the Heat Diffusion equation for transient, one-dimensional (say, $x$ only), with internal energy generation, and constant thermal conductivity.

$$
\frac{\partial^{2} T}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{k}=\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

## Question 2

Reduce the Heat Diffusion equation for steady, one-dimensional (say, $x$ only), with internal energy generation, and constant thermal conductivity.

$$
\frac{\partial^{2} T}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{k}=0
$$

## Question 3

Reduce the Heat Diffusion equation for transient, one-dimensional (say, $x$ only), no internal energy generation, and constant thermal conductivity.

$$
\frac{\partial^{2} T}{\partial x^{2}}=\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

## Question 4

Reduce the Heat Diffusion equation for transient, one-dimensional (say, $x$ only), with internal energy generation, and variable thermal conductivity.

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right)+\dot{e}_{g}=\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

# Boundary and Initial Conditions

The order of the spatial derivative dictates the number of boundary conditions necessary for each spatial direction.

The order of the temporal derivative dictates the number of initial conditions necessary.

## Example

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(k \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(k \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\right)+\dot{e}_{g}=\rho c_{v} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$

$$
\left(2^{\text {nd}} \text{ order in space} \right) \times(3-\mathrm{D})=6 \text{ boundary conditions}
$$

$$
\left( 1^{\text {st}} \text { order in time }\right) = 1 \text { initial condition }
$$

Requires seven (7) total conditions on only the temperature!

## What Are These Boundary Conditions?

For a given problem, there is need for only a finite number of boundary conditions.
As far as we're concerned, there will be only two (2) types:

* B.C. of the FIRST kind (Dirichlet)
  * the function itself is prescribed
* B.C. of the SECOND kind (Neumann)
  * the first derivative is prescribed

# Worked Example 1

Consider a pot used to cook beef stew on top of an electric range. The bottom section of the pot has a thickness $L$ and a diameter of $D$. The electric heating unit on the range top consumes a certain amount of power during cooking, and a certain percentage of the heat generated in the heating element is transferred to the bottom surface of the pot $\left(\dot{Q} / A_{s}\right)$. During steady operation, the temperature of the inner surface of the pot is measured to be a constant temperature $T_{i}$. Assuming a temperature dependent thermal conductivity and one-dimensional heat transfer, express the heat diffusion equation with the appropriate boundary conditions for the bottom section of the pot during this cooking process.

## Solution

Can we come up with a model for the temperature at any position in the pot?

$$
\nabla \cdot(k \vec{\nabla} T)+\cancelto{0}{\dot{e}_g}=\rho c \cancelto{0}{\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right)=0
$$

### Boundary Conditions

1. $T(x=L)=T_i$
2. $\left. \frac{dT}{dx} \right|_{x=0} = \left. -\frac{1}{k} \frac{\dot{Q}}{A_s} \right)_\text{flux}$

To find the second

$$
\left. \frac{\dot{Q}}{A_s} \right)_\text{flux} = -k \left. \frac{dT}{dx} \right|_{x=0}
$$

# Worked Problem 2

Consider the East wall of a house that has a thickness of $L$. The outer surface of the
wall exchanges heat by both convection and radiation. The interior of the house
is maintained at $T_{\infty, 1},$ while the ambient air temperature outside remains at $T_{\infty, 2}$.
The sky, the ground, and the surfaces of the surrounding structures at this location can be modeled as a surface at an effective temperature of $T_{\text {sky}}$ for radiation exchange on the outer surface. The radiation exchange between the inner surface of the wall and the surfaces of the walls, floor, and ceiling it faces is negligible. The
convection heat transfer coefficients on the inner and outer surfaces of the wall are
$h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$, respectively. The thermal conductivity of the wall material is $k$ and the emissivity of the outer surface is $\varepsilon$. Assuming the heat transfer through the wall to be steady and one-dimensional, express the mathematical formulation of this heat
conduction problem including the boundary conditions.

$$
\frac{d^{2} T}{d x^{2}}=0
$$

$$
\left. \frac{d T}{d x}\right|_{x=0}=-\frac{h_1}{k} \left(T_{(0)}-T_{\infty,1}\right)
$$

$$
\left. \frac{d T}{d x}\right|_{x=L}=-\frac{h_2}{k} \left(T_{(L)}-T_{\infty,2}\right) - \frac{\varepsilon \sigma}{k} \left( T^4_{(L)} -T^4_\text{sky} \right)
$$
