## Questions 1

A plane wall of thickness $2 L$ and constant thermal conductivity $k$ is subjected to convection at both surfaces with ambient temperature $T_{\infty, 1}$ and heat transfer coefficient $h_{1}$ at the left surface, and corresponding $T_{\infty, 2}$ and $h_{2}$ values at the right surface, where $T_{\infty, 1}>T_{s, 1}>T_{s, 2}>T_{\infty, 2}$. Taking the positive direction of $x$ to be from the wall center to the right with steady conditions, what is the correct expression for the boundary condition on the left surface (i.e., $x=-L)$?

$$
\boxed{
\left.\frac{d T}{d x}\right|_{x=-L}=-\frac{h}{k}\left(T_{\infty, 1}-T_{s, 1}\right)
}
$$

## Question 2

A plane wall of thickness $2 L$ and constant thermal conductivity $k$ is subjected to convection at both surfaces with ambient temperature $T_{\infty, 1}$ and heat transfer coefficient $h_{1}$ at the left surface, and corresponding $T_{\infty, 2}$ and $h_{2}$ values at the right surface, where $T_{\infty, 1}>T_{s, 1}>T_{s, 2}>T_{\infty, 2}$. Taking the positive direction of $x$ to be from the wall center to the right with steady conditions, what is the correct expression for the boundary condition on the right surface (i.e., $x=+L$ )?

$$
\boxed{
\left.\frac{d T}{d x}\right|_{x=L}=-\frac{h}{k}\left(T_{s, 2}-T_{\infty, 2}\right)
}

In an attempt to take over the tri-state area, Dr. Doofenshmirtz purchases a small radioactive device to power his robot, Norm. The radioactive object is spherical with a radius of $r_{0}=0.04 \mathrm{~m}$ and generates thermal energy at a constant rate of $\dot{e}_{g}=5 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{w} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. This causes the surface temperature of the round object to reach $T_{s}=111^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The heat that is generated is steadily dissipated to the surroundings. If the thermal conductivity of the round object is $k=15 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}$,

a. first, establish the differential equation and boundary conditions for one-dimensional heat transfer;
b. then solve the differential equation to obtain a relation for the variation of temperature in the sphere; and
c. finally, determine the temperature at the center of the sphere

## Working

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{k}&= 0\\
T\left(r=r_{0}\right)&=T_{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\left.\frac{d T}{d_{r}} \right|_{r=0}=0
$$

$$
\int \partial\left(r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)=-\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{{k}} \int r^2 \partial r
$$

$$
r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}=-\frac{\dot{e}_{y}}{3 k} r^{3}+C_{1}
$$

$$
\int \partial T=-\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{3 k} \int r \partial r+ \int\frac{C_1}{r^2} \partial r
$$

$$
T=-\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{6 k} r^{2}-\frac{C_{1}}{r}+C_{2}
$$

$$
T=-\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{3 k}\int r \partial r+ \int \frac{C_{1} }{r^{2} }\partial r
$$

$$
T= -\frac{\dot{e}_g}{6 k} r^{2}-\frac{C_1}{r}+C_2
$$

$$
\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2} \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{k}=0
$$

$$
T\left(r_{0}\right)=-\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{6 k} { r_0}^{2}+C_{2}=T_{s}
$$

$$
C_{2}=T_{s}+\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{6k} r_{0}^{2}
$$

$$
\boxed{
T(r)=\frac{\dot{e}_{g}}{6 k}\left(r_{0}^{2}-r^{2}\right)+T_{s}
}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
T(0)&=\frac{e_{g}}{6k} r_{0}^{2}+T_{s}\\
&=\frac{\left(5 \times 10^{7} \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^{3}}\right)}{6\left(15 \frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$

# Worked Example 2

To cool the $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ diameter nuclear fuel rods $(k=30 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K})$ within your professor's secret Arc Reactor, he has designed the rods to be concentrically encased within $2 \mathrm{~cm}$ diameter tubes of flowing water. Thermal energy is uniformly generated in the fuel rods at a rate of $\dot{e}_{g}=50 \mathrm{MW} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. The convection heat transfer coefficient between the fuel rod and the cooling water is $h_{r}=13 \mathrm{~kW} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ and between the cooling water and the tube surface is $h_{c}=2 \mathrm{~kW} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. The temperature of the concentric tube encasing the cooling water is measured to be $T_{c}=40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If the temperature of the fuel rod also remains fixed, and we neglect any changes in temperature of the cooling water between the inlet and exit of this section, determine the average temperature of the cooling water $\left(T_{\infty}\right)$.

# Exam

Only after chapters 1 and 2.

4 FE questions on average.
If you spend more than 6-7 minutes, you're missing the point, move on.
Bulk of points come from worked questions.

Maybe cartesian, cylindrical, spherical, heat generation.

May need to integrate.
