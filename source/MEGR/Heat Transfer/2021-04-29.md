5 FE, 4 Long.

# Chapter 6
Boundary Layers, $\delta_h$, $\delta_t$  
Classifications:

* Forces vs. Free
* Internal vs. External
* Laminar vs. Turbulent

# Chapter 7

## External

($5\times 10^5$)

* flat plate
* cylinders & spheres
* Non-circular cross-section

* tube banks

# Chapter 8

## Internal

($2,300$)  
($10,000$)

* Entrance Region: $L_h$, $L_t$
* Hydraulic Diameter: $D_H = \frac{4A_C}{P}$
* Developing vs. Fully developed
* Circular & Non-circular cross-section
* Laminar vs. Turbulent
* $T_s$ vs $\dot{Q}''$
* Includes $P_\text{drop}$, $\dot{V}$, not $\dot{W}$

goal is to not have any transitional flow.
