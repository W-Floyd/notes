I shall pick the material to be Douglas Fir, which has a Modulus of Rigidity of $G=4.1 \cdot 10^9 !_pa$.

Given the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    l &= 1 !_m\\
    k &= 10^5 !_nmprad
\end{aligned}
$$

We know that (for a circular rod):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    k &= \frac{GJ_p}{l}\\
    J_p &= \frac{\pi}{2} r^4
\end{aligned}
$$

thus we can solve:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    10^5 &= \frac{4.1 \cdot 10^9 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot r^4}{1}\\
    !Answer(r)(\approx)(0.06277 !_m)\\
    !Answer(r)(\approx)(6.3 !_cm)
\end{aligned}
$$
