# Solution

## Goal

Find the amplitude of the restoring force $F_R$ on the moon.

## Given

$$
\begin{aligned}
    !ADefGiven(m)(m)(2)(\mathrm{~kg})\\
    !ADefGiven(l)(l)(0.5)(\mathrm{~m})\\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Assumptions

On the moon, so gravity is:

$$
    !DefGiven(g)(g)(1.625)(!mpsq)
$$

## Working

We know, as from 1.1, that:

$$
F_R(\theta) = mgl\sin{\theta}\\
$$

Also as before, we assume $\sin{\theta}=1$ as that is it's maximum value.
Hence:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_R(\theta) &= mgl\\
    &= !m \cdot !g \cdot !l\\
    !Answer(F_R)(=)(!math(!m*!g*!l)!nm)\\
\end{aligned}
$$
