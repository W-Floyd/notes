# Problem Statement

Use LaGrange's formulation to calculate the equation of motion and the natural frequency of the system of Fig. 1.
Model each of the pulley brackets as a longitudinal spring of stiffness $k$, and assume the inertia of the pulleys is negligible.

# Solution

## Goal

Find equation of motion and $\omega_n$.

## Given

Pulley brackets are both of spring stiffness $k$, inertia of pulley is negligible.

## Working

The kinetic energy of the system is of the mass $m$ alone, given by:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2
$$

The potential energy of the system is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    U &= \cancelto{1}{2\cdot \frac{1}{2}  \cdot k \cdot} \left( \frac{x}{4} \right)^2 - mgx\\
    U &= k \cdot \left( \frac{x}{4} \right)^2 - mgx\\
    U &= \frac{k x^2}{16} - mgx
\end{aligned}
$$

We know that for $L=T-U$, the following is true:

$$
\frac{d}{d t}\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_{i}}\right)-\frac{\partial T}{\partial q_{i}}+\frac{\partial U}{\partial q_{i}}=0
$$

For our case $q_i=x$, thus:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{d t}\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{x}}\right)-\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}&=0\\
    \frac{d}{dt} \left( m \dot{x} \right) + \frac{kx}{8} - mg &= 0\\
    m\ddot{x} + \frac{kx}{8} - mg &= 0\\
    !Answer(\ddot{x} + \frac{kx}{8 m} - g)(=)(0)
\end{aligned}
$$

we know from the form that natural frequency is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \omega_n &= \sqrt{\frac{k}{8m}}\\
    !Answer(\omega_n)(=)(\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} !_rads)
\end{aligned}
$$
