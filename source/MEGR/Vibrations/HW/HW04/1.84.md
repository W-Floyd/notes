# Problem Statement

Consider the punch fixture. (Fig. 5) If the punch strikes the mass off center, it is possible that the steel bar may vibrate in torsion. The mass is $1000 \mathrm{~kg}$ and the bar is $0.25 \mathrm{~m}$ long, with a square cross section of $0.1 \mathrm{~m}$ on a side. The mass polar moment of inertia $\left(J_{p}\right)$ of the tip mass is $10 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. The polar moment of inertia for a square bar is $b^{4} / 6$, where $b$ is the length of a side of the square. Compute both the torsion and longitudinal natural frequencies. Which is larger?
