# Problem Statement

A bar of negligible mass fixed with a tip mass forms part of a machine used to punch holes in a sheet of metal as it passes the fixture. (Fig. 4) The impact against the mass and bar fixture causes the bar to vibrate, and the speed of the process demands that the frequency of vibration not interfere with the process. The static design yields a mass of $50 \mathrm{~kg}$ and that the bar be made of steel of length, $0.25 \mathrm{~m}$ with a cross-sectional area of $0.01 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Compute the system's natural frequency.
