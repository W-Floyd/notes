# Equivalent Conditions for a Nonsingular Matrix

If $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix, then the statements below are
equivalent:

1.  $A$ is invertible.
2.  $A \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution for every
    $n \times 1$ column matrix $\mathbf{b}$.
3.  $A \mathbf{x}=O$ has only the trivial solution.
4.  $A$ is row-equivalent to $I_{n}$.
5.  $A$ can be written as the product of elementary matrices.
6.  $\operatorname{det}(A) \neq 0$
