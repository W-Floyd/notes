# Row-Echelon Form and Reduced Row-Echelon Form

A matrix in **row-echelon form** has the properties below.

1. Any rows consisting entirely of zeros occur at the bottom of the matrix.
2. For each row that does not consist entirely of zeros, the first nonzero entry is 1 (called a leading 1 ).
3. For two successive (nonzero) rows, the leading 1 in the higher row is farther to the left than the leading 1 in the lower row.

A matrix in row-echelon form is in **reduced row-echelon form** when every column that has a leading 1 has zeros in every position above and below its leading 1.
