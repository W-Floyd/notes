# Syllabus

We will need the book, though not in class. She will pull it up on the
screen as needed.

Homework sets are graded. Usually one page. Do not need to post to
Canvas - hand in. We do not need to print if we don't want to, but we
can. They need to be handed in on time.

Practice sets can be a little more flexible, but only as needed.

# Linear Equations in $n$ variables

Has form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 + ... + a_n x_n &= b \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Parametric Representation

Describes the entire solution set of an equation (or a system of
equations).

Example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
3x + 2y -z = 3\\
z = 3x + 2y -3\\
x = s\\
y = t
\end{aligned}
$$ $$
\begin{aligned}
\{ \left( s, t, 3s + 2t - 3 \right) | s, t \in \mathbb{R} \}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
3x = 3 -2y +z \\
y&=s\\
z&=t\\
x = 1 - \frac{2}{3} y + \frac{1}{3} z\\
\end{aligned}\\
$$ $$
\begin{aligned}
\{ \left( 1- \frac{2}{3}s + \frac{1}{3}t, s, t \right) | s, t \in \mathbb{R} \}
\end{aligned}
$$
