# 9.1 - Hypothesis Testing for Two Populations

## Summary



# Class

Compares two parameters from two populations.

## Sampling methods:
1. Independent Samples
* The sample selected from one population is not related to the sample selected from the second population.
2. Dependent Samples (paired or matched samples)
* Each member of one sample corresponds to a menber of the other sample. Often involves: identical twins, before and after results, use of the same sample in different trials, or individuals with specific characteristics, (race, gender, etc.)

## Two Sample Hypothesis Test (Independent Samples)

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
H_{0}: \mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=d_{0} \\
H_{a}: \mu_{1}-\mu_{2} \neq d_{0}
\end{array}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
H_{0}: \mu_{1}-\mu_{2} \leq d_{0} \\
H_{2}: \mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>d_{0}
\end{array}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
H_{0}: \mu_{1}-\mu_{2} \geq d_{0} \\
H_{a}: \mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<d_{0}
\end{array}
\right.\right.\right.
$$

## Z-test for Independent Samples

1. The random samples must be independent
2. Each sample size must be at least 40

**OR** normal population with $\sigma$ known for each
sample

## Test Statistic

$$
Z=\frac{\left(\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}\right)-\left(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}}}
$$

Where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are sample sizes.

When the samples are large $(n \geq 40)$, you can replace $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ with $s_1$ and $s_2$.

### Example Thread Example

A manufacturer claims that the average tensile strength of thread $A$ exceeds the average tensile strength of thread $B$ by at least 12 kilograms. To test this claim, 50 pieces of each type of thread were tested under similar conditions. Type $A$ thread had an average ...

$$
\begin{array}{l}
H_{0}: \mu_{A}-\mu_{B} \geq 12 \\
H_{a}: \mu_{A}-\mu_{B}<12 \\
\alpha=0.05
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l|l}
\text{Sample A} & \text{Sample B} \\
\hline
\bar{x}_{A}=86.7 & \bar{x}_{B}=77.8 \\
S_{A}=6.28 & S_{B}=5.61 \\
n_{A}=50 & n_{B}=50
\end{array}
$$

#### Step 1 - Test Statistic

$$
Z=\frac{(86.7-77.8)-12}{\sqrt{\frac{(6.28)^{2}}{50}+\frac{(5.61)^{2}}{50}}}=-2.60
$$

#### Step 2 - Rejection Region

$$
\begin{aligned}
-Z_\alpha  &= \operatorname{invnorm}\left(.0\bar{1}, 0, 1 \right) \\
&= -1.645 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## P-Value

How do we find?

1. Left tailed test: P-value = Area to left of test statistic
2. Right-tailed test: P-value = Area to right of test statistic
3. Two-tailed test: P-value = 2 (area in 1 of the tails).

For two tail, prob that value is out of region

$$
P=1-\operatorname{normCdf}\left( -|Z|, |Z|, 0, 1 \right)
$$

1. If p-value $\leq a$, then reject $H_{0}$
2. If p-value $>a$, then fail to reject $H_{0}$.
