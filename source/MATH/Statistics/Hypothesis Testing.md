# Tests of Hypotheses Based on a Single Sample

## Hypotheses and Test Procedures

### Hypothesis

A **statistical hypothesis**, or just hypothesis, is a claim or assertion either about the value of a single parameter (population characteristic or characteristic of a probability distribution), about the values of several parameters, or about the form of an entire probability distribution.

#### Null Hypothesis

The null hypothesis, denoted by $H_{0}$, is the claim that is initially assumed to be true (the "prior belief" claim). The alternative hypothesis, denoted by $H_{\mathrm{a}}$, is the assertion that is contradictory to $H_{0}$.

The null hypothesis will be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis only if sample evidence suggests that $H_{0}$ is false. If the sample does not strongly contradict $H_{0},$ we will continue to believe in the plausibility of the null hypothesis. The two possible conclusions from a hypothesis-testing analysis are then reject $H_{0}$ or fail to reject $H_{0}$.

The alternative to the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \theta=\theta_{0}$ will look like one of the following three
assertions:

1. $H_{\mathrm{a}}: \theta>\theta_{0}$ (in which case the implicit null hypothesis is $\left.\theta \leq \theta_{0}\right)$
2. $H_{\mathrm{a}}: \theta<\theta_{0}$ (in which case the implicit null hypothesis is $\left.\theta \geq \theta_{0}\right),$ or
3. $H_{\mathrm{a}}: \theta \neq \theta_{0}$

## Test Procedures and $P$ -Values

## Errors in Hypothesis Testing

A **type I error** consists of rejecting the null hypothesis $H_{0}$ when it is true. False positive.

A **type II error** involves not rejecting $H_{0}$ when it is false. False negative.
