## Polymer Molecules

-   Most polymeric materials are composed of very large molecular chains
    with side groups of various atoms $(\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Cl},$ etc.
    $)$ or organic groups such as methyl, ethyl, or phenyl groups.
-   These macromolecules are composed of repeat units, smaller
    structural entities, which are repeated along the chain.

## The Chemistry of Polymer Molecules

-   Repeat units for some of the chemically simple polymers
    \[polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, poly(vinyl chloride),
    polypropylene, etc.\] are presented in Table 14.3 . A homopolymer is
    one for which all of the repeat units are the same type. The chains
    for copolymers are composed of two or more kinds of repeat units.
-   Repeat units are classified according to the number of active bonds
    (i.e., functionality):
    -   For bifunctional monomers, a two-dimensional chainlike structure
        results from a monomer that has two active bonds.
    -   Trifunctional monomers have three active bonds, from which
        three-dimensional network structures form.

## Molecular Weight

-   Molecular weights for high polymers may be in excess of a million.
    Because all molecules are not of the same size, there is a
    distribution of molecular weights.
-   Molecular weight is often expressed in terms of number and weight
    averages; values for these parameters may be determined using
    Equations $14.5 \mathrm{a}$ and $14.5 \mathrm{b},$ respectively.
-   Chain length may also be specified by degree of polymerization - the
    number of repeat units per average molecule (Equation 14.6 ).

## Molecular Shape

-   Molecular entanglements occur when the chains assume twisted,
    coiled, and kinked shapes or contours as a consequence of chain bond
    rotations.
-   Rotational flexibility is diminished when double chain bonds are
    present and also when bulky side groups are part of the repeat unit.

## Molecular Structure

-   Four different polymer molecular chain structures are possible:
    linear (Figure $14.7 a$ ) branched (Figure $14.7 b),$ crosslinked
    (Figure $14.7 c),$ and network (Figure $14.7 d$ ).
