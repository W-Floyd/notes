# Problem Statement

(a) What is the distinction between cement and concrete? (b) Cite three
    important limitations that restrict the use of concrete as a
    structural material. (c) Briefly explain three techniques that are
    used to strengthen concrete by reinforcement.

# Solution

a.  **Concrete** is composed of an aggregate (usually gravel and sand)
    bound together with a binder. **Cement** is the binder used in
    concrete.

b.  1.  *Brittle* and *weak* in **tension**
    2.  Thermal **expansion** and **contraction** in large structures
    3.  **Cracking** due to *water penetration and freeze/thaw cycles*.

c.  Concrete may be reinforced in a number of ways

    -   Embedded materials, such as:
        -   Steel rods, bars (**rebar**), wires, and mesh
        -   Fibers, such as:
            -   Glass
            -   Steel
            -   Nylon
            -   Polyethylene
    -   *Prestressed* - Tensioned steel is embedded in the concrete as
        it is cast, which compresses the cured concrete when released.
    -   *Posttensioned* - Vias are cast for steel cables, which are
        tensioned after the cement is cured, putting the concrete in
        tensioned.
