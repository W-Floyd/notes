# Problem Statement

Briefly describe laminar composites. What is the prime reason for fabricating these materials?

# Solution

A laminar composite is made up of sheets adhered together. Each sheet is stronger in a different direction to the one prior. This is called a laminate. Its properties depend on how these layers are arranged. These layouts are unidirectional, cross-ply, angle-ply and multidirectional.

This is done so as to utilize the isotropic strength characteristics of any given layer, which can lend itself well to manufacturing certain parts economically. For example, plywood/particleboard is cheap to manufacture, and effective to use.
