# Problem Statement

In your own words, briefly describe the phenomenon of viscoelasticity.

# Solution

**Viscoelasticity** is the property exhibited when the material is above
the glass transition temperature, but close enough to still demonstrate
some characteristics of a both a solid and a liquid. It will produce an
instantaneous elastic strain, then continue to increase more similarly
to how a fluid might.
