# Problem Statement

Which of the following would you expect to be elastomers and which
thermosetting polymers at room temperature? Justify each choice.

(a) Epoxy having a network structure
(b) Lightly crosslinked poly(styrene-butadiene) random copolymer that
    has a glass-transition temperature of $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
(c) Lightly branched and semicrystalline polytetrafluoroethylene that
    has a glass-transition temperature of $-100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
(d) Heavily crosslinked poly(ethylene-propylene) random copolymer that
    has a glass-transition temperature of $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
(e) Thermoplastic elastomer that has a glass-transition temperature of
    $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

# Solution

(a) Epoxy will be **thermosetting**, due to network structure.

(b) Lightly crosslinked poly(styrene-butadiene) random copolymer that
    has a glass-transition temperature of $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ will
    be an **elastomer**, because

    -   it is above the given glass transition temperature
        ($-50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ vs $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$)
    -   it is lightly crosslinked
    -   it is a random copolymer

(c) Lightly branched and semicrystalline polytetrafluoroethylene that
    has a glass-transition temperature of $-100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ will
    be **neither**, as it is neither networked nor crosslinked.

(d) Heavily crosslinked poly(ethylene-propylene) random copolymer that
    has a glass-transition temperature of $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ would
    be an **elastomer** due to being so heavily crosslinked.

(e) Thermoplastic elastomer that has a glass-transition temperature of
    $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ will be **neither**, as it is not above its
    glass transition temperature, and cannot be a thermosetting polymer
    as it is a thermoplastic.
