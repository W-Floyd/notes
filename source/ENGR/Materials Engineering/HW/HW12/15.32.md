# Problem Statement

Of the polymers listed in Table 15.2, which polymer(s) would be best
suited for use as ice cube trays? Why?

# Solution

Icecube trays are twisted when ice is released, meaning that a
temperature above the glass transition temperature is desired.
Considering the maximum temperature to be $-18^\circ \text{C}$, as that
is the typical setting for home freezers.

From Table 15.2 glass transition temperatures:

$$
\begin{array}{lc}
\text {Material} & {\left[^{\circ} \boldsymbol{C}(\boldsymbol{F})\right]} \\
\hline \text { Polyethylene (low density) } & -110(-165) \\
\hline \text { Polytetrafluoroethylene } & -97(-140) \\
\hline \text { Polyethylene (high density) } & -90(-130) \\
\hline \text { Polypropylene } & -18(0)
\end{array}
$$

Thus Polyethylene (both low and high density), Polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE), and Polypropylene would be candidates.
