# Problem Statement

(a) Contrast the manner in which stress relaxation and viscoelastic
    creep tests are conducted.
(b) For each of these tests, cite the experimental parameter of interest
    and how it is determined.

# Solution

a)  -   **Stress relaxation** measures stress over time required to
        maintain a given strain.
    -   **Viscoelastic creep** measures strain over time for a given
        stress.

b)  -   **Stress relaxation** is used to calculate a *relaxation
        modulus*.
    -   **Viscoelastic creep** this is used to produce a *creep
        modulus*.
