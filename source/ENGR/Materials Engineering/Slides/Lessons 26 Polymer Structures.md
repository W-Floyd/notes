# Slide 2 - **Devo/Prayer**

## For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, **(nor any test)**, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## **Romans 8:38-39**

## Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

## **Philippians 4:4-7**

# Slide 3 - **Devo/Prayer**

## Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, [***a***](http://biblehub.com/niv/james/1.htm#footnotes) whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.

## **James 1:2-4**

# Slide 4 - **Devo/Prayer**

## Trust in the Lord with all your heart     and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him,     and he will make your paths straight.

## **Proverbs 3:5-6**

# Slide 5

## **In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps.**

## **Proverbs 16:9**

## **Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well.**

## **1 Thes 2:8**

**Devo/Prayer**

# Slide 6 - **Easter - It's Even More Than We Imagine**

***In Jesus, God Frees Us From the Guilt, Condemnation, & Power of
Sin...***

Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God
something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself
nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human
likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by
becoming obedient to death---even death on a cross!

**Philippians 2:6-8**

Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching
them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you
always, to the very end of the age.

**Matthew 28:19-20**

# Slide 10 - **Polymer Structures**

**Why It Matters...**

-   What are the general structural and chemical characteristics of
    polymer molecules?

-   What are some of the common polymeric materials, and how do they
    differ chemically?

-   How is the crystalline state in polymers different from that in
    metals and ceramics ?

![](./Lessons%2026%20Polymer%20Structures/img9.png)

# Slide 11 - **Types of Materials**

-   Metals: Metallic bonding - sea of electrons

-   Strong/stiff, ductile, usually crystalline

-   High thermal & electrical conductivity

-   Opaque, reflective.

-   Polymers/plastics: Covalent bonding - sharing of electrons

-   Soft, ductile, usually non-crystalline, low strength, low density,
    lower melting temps, high coefficients of thermal expansion

-   Thermal & electrical insulators

-   Optically translucent or transparent.

-   Ceramics: ionic bonding - transfer of electrons

-   Compounds of metallic & non-metallic elements (oxides, carbides,
    nitrides, sulfides)

-   Brittle, glassy

-   Non-conducting (insulators)

-   Composites: combination of two or more individual materials/phases
    to obtain a more desirable combination of properties than can be
    obtained with each individual material (e.g., low density and high
    strength)

-   Noah used pitch (a natural polymer) for the ark

![](./Lessons%2026%20Polymer%20Structures/img12.png)

# Slide 14 - **Polymer Composition**

## Most polymers are organic hydrocarbons

## - i.e., made up of H and C

-   Saturated hydrocarbons

-   Each carbon singly bonded to four other atoms (covalent)

-   Example:

-   Ethane, C2H6

# Slide 15

![](./Lessons%2026%20Polymer%20Structures/img14.png)

# Slide 16 - **Unsaturated Hydrocarbons**

-   Double & triple bonds somewhat unstable - can form new bonds

-   Triple bond found in acetylene or ethyne - C2H2

![](./Lessons%2026%20Polymer%20Structures/img15.png)

# Slide 17 - **Isomerism**

-   Isomerism

-   two compounds with same chemical formula can have quite different
    structures/repeat units

## for example: C8H18

-   normal-octane
-   2,4-dimethylhexane

\- Leads to a distribution of molecular weights (calculate average)

![](./Lessons%2026%20Polymer%20Structures/img22.png)

# Slide 24 - **Molecular Weight Distribution**

*xi* = number fraction of chains in size range *i*

Adapted from Fig. 14.4, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

*wi* = weight fraction of chains in size range *i*

*Mi* = mean (middle) molecular weight of size range *i*

# Slide 27 - **Polymers - Molecular Shape**

# Slide 34 - **Polymer Crystallinity**

## Polymers are rarely 100% crystalline

-   Difficult for all regions of all chains to become aligned

-   Degree of crystallinity expressed as % crystallinity.

\-- Some physical properties depend on % crystallinity.

\-- Heat treating causes crystalline regions to grow and % crystallinity
to increase.
