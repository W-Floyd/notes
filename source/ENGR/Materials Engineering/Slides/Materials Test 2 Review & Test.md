# Slide 17 - **Summary - Mechanical Properties of Metals**

-   Stress and strain: These are size-independent

measures of load and displacement, respectively.

shows a linear relation between stress and strain.

To minimize deformation, select a material with a

large elastic modulus ( *E* or *G*).

-   Toughness: The energy needed to break a unit

volume of material.

-   Ductility: The plastic strain at failure.

-   Plastic behavior: This permanent deformation

behavior occurs when the tensile (or compressive)

uniaxial stress reaches s *y*.

# Slide 21 - **Summary - Dislocations & Strengthening Mechanisms**

-   Dislocations are observed primarily in metals and alloys.

-   Strength is increased by making dislocation motion difficult.

-   Strength of metals may be increased by:

\-- decreasing grain size

\-- solid solution strengthening

\-- cold working

\-- precipitate hardening

-   A cold-worked metal that is heat treated may experience

recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth - its properties

will be altered.

# Slide 22

**Big Picture**

-   Plastic deformation requires moving of dislocations (edge, screw or
    mixed) in crystal structure

***Anything that hinders dislocation movement through the crystal will
increase the yield strength and hardness of a material***

# Slide 23 - **Deformation Mechanisms**

## Slip System (where least "atomic distortion" occurs)

-   Slip plane - plane on which easiest slippage occurs

-   Highest planar densities (and large interplanar spacings)

-   Slip directions - directions of movement

-   Highest linear densities

Adapted from Fig. 7.6, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

-   FCC Slip occurs on {111} planes (close-packed) in \<110\> directions
    (close-packed)

=\> total of 12 slip systems in FCC

-   For BCC & HCP there are fewer slip systems.

![](./Materials%20Test%202%20Review%20&%20Test/img22.png)

# Slide 24 - **Dislocation Motion/Plastic Deformation**

-   Plastic deformation occurs as dislocations move along slip planes in
    slip directions perpendicular to the dislocation line
-   The slip direction is the same as the Burgers vector direction for
    edge dislocation and perpendicular for screw

**Edge dislocation**

**Screw dislocation**

# Slide 33 - **Summary - Failure**

-   Sharp corners produce large stress concentrations

and premature failure.

-   Engineering materials not as strong as predicted by theory

-   Flaws act as stress concentrators that cause failure at

stresses lower than theoretical values.

-   Failure type depends on *T* and *s*:

-   For simple fracture (noncyclic *s* and *T* \< 0.4 *Tm)*, failure
    stress

decreases with:

\- Increased maximum flaw size

\- Decreased *T*

\- Increased rate of loading

\- For fatigue (cyclic *s*):

\- Cycles to fail decreases as D *s* increases.

\- For creep ( *T* \> 0.4 *Tm*):

\- Time to rupture decreases as *s* or *T* increases.

-   Larger grains resist creep better

# Slide 36 - **Criterion for Crack Propagation**

Crack propagates if crack-tip stress (s *m*) exceeds a critical stress
(s *c*)

where

-   *E* = modulus of elasticity
-   s = specific surface energy
-   *a* = length of surface crack or half length of internal crack

![](./Materials%20Test%202%20Review%20&%20Test/img35.png)

# Slide 37 - **Fracture Toughness (a different "K")**

-   Fracture toughness (K1C) - a measure of a materials resistance to
    brittle fracture when a crack is present

-   Note the "1" denotes mode I (tensile loading - most common)

-   Think of the energy required to make a crack grow

-   Unusual units of MPa-m1/2 or ksi-in1/2

# Slide 40 - **Creep**

## Sample deformation at a constant stress (s) vs. time

Adapted from

Fig. 8.28, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

Primary Creep: slope (creep rate) decreases with time (strain
hardening).

Secondary Creep: steady-state i.e., constant slope (De/Dt).

Tertiary Creep: slope (creep rate) increases with time (voids, cracks
form).

***A cylindrical specimen of steel having a diameter of 15.2 mm (0.60
in.) and length of 250 mm (10.0 in.) is deformed elastically in tension
with a force of 48,900 N (11,000 lbf). Using the data contained in Table
6.1, determine the following:***

***a) The amount by which this specimen will elongate in the direction
of the applied stress.***

***b) The change in diameter of the specimen. Will the diameter increase
or decrease?***

***A cylindrical specimen of cold-worked copper has a ductility (%EL) of
15%.***

-   ***How much cold work was done?***

-   ***If its cold-worked radius is 6.4 mm (0.25 in.), what was its
    radius before deformation?***

    stress for a Factor of Safety of 3?***

-   ***After cold work it is 7 in long. How much can it be stretched
    before failure?***
