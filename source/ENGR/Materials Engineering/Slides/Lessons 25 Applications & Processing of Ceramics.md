# Slide 2 - **Devo/Prayer**

## **Rejoice** in the Lord always. I will say it again: **Rejoice!** Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. **Do not be anxious** about anything, but in every situation, by **prayer and petition**, with **thanksgiving**, present your requests to God.  And the **peace of God**, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

## **Philippians 4:4-7**

# Slide 3 - **Holiday Devo**

## **Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.  You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.  You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.  Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven---as her great love has shown.**

## **Luke 7:44-47**

# Slide 4 - **Devo/Prayer**

## Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. **Cast all your anxiety on him because He cares for you.**

# Slide 5 - **Devo/Prayer**

## Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.

# Slide 12 - **Refractories**

-   High temperature materials with low thermal conductivity/thermal
    expansion (e.g., in high temperature furnaces)

-   Consider the Silica (SiO2) - Alumina (Al2O3) system

-   Fireclay refractories (alumina rich): insulate furnaces (
    **non-structural**---some liquid is tolerable)

-   Silica refractories (silica rich): high temp, **load bearing**
    applications

(\< 1 wt% alumina to minimize liquid in brick)

# Slide 13 - **Sensors**

-   Example: ZrO2 as an oxygen sensor

-   Principle: Increase diffusion rate of oxygen to produce rapid
    response of sensor signal to change in oxygen concentration

A substituting Ca2+ ion

removes a Zr 4+ ion and

an O2- ion.

Ca

-   Approach:

Add Ca impurity to ZrO2:

\-- Increases O2- diffusion rate

sensor

-   Operation:

\-- Voltage difference produced when O2- ions diffuse from the external
surface through the sensor to the reference gas surface. \-- Magnitude
of voltage difference  partial pressure of oxygen at the external
surface

# Slide 14 - **Parts for Automobile Engines**

## Advantages:

-   Operate at high temperatures - high efficiencies

-   Difficult to remove internal voids (that weaken structures)

-   Ceramic parts are difficult to form and machine

-   Potential candidate materials: Si3N4, SiC, & ZrO2

-   Possible engine parts: engine block & piston coatings

shrinkage
