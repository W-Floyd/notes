# Slide 11 - **Predeformation by Drawing**

-   Drawing...(ex: monofilament fishline)

    -   Stretches the polymer prior to use

    -   Aligns chains in the stretching direction

-   Results of drawing:

    -   Increases the elastic modulus ( *E*) in the

stretching direction

    * Increases the tensile strength ( _TS_) in the

stretching direction

    * Decreases ductility (% _EL_)

-   Annealing after drawing...

        * Decreases chain alignment

        * Reverses effects of drawing (reduces _E_ and

    *TS*, enhances %EL)

-   Similar to effects of cold working in metals

    -   Hard and brittle
    -   Do NOT soften w/heating
    -   Vulcanized rubber, epoxies, polyester resin, phenolic resin

-   Thermoplastic

-   Can be reversibly cooled & reheated, i.e. recycled

-   Heat until soft, shape as desired, then cool

-   ex: polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene.

-   Thermoset

-   When heated forms a molecular network (chemical reaction)

-   Degrades (doesn't melt) when heated

-   A prepolymer molded into desired shape, then chemical reaction
    occurs

-   ex: urethane, epoxy

Billmeyer, Jr., *Textbook of Polymer Science,* 2nd edition, John Wiley &
Sons, 1971.)

Thermoplastics and some thermosets

-   When ram retracts, plastic pellets drop from hopper into barrel
-   Ram forces plastic into the heating chamber (around the spreader)
    where the plastic melts as it moves forward
-   Molten plastic is forced under pressure (injected) into the mold
    cavity where it assumes the shape of the mold

Barrel

Fig. 15.25, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e*. (Fig. 15.25 is from
*Encyclopædia Britannica,* 1997.)

Thermoplastics

-   Plastic pellets drop from hopper onto the turning screw
-   Plastic pellets melt as the turning screw pushes them forward by the
    heaters
-   Molten polymer is forced under pressure through the shaping die to
    form the final product (extrudate)

# Slide 27 - **Polymer Additives**

## Improve mechanical properties, processability, durability, etc.

-   Fillers

    etc.

-   Added to reduce the glass transition

temperature *Tg* below room temperature

-   Presence of plasticizer transforms brittle polymer to a ductile one
-   Commonly added to PVC - otherwise it is brittle
