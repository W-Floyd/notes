# Slide 2 - **Devo/Prayer - Salvation Made Simple**

-   God is Righteous

-   For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (Ro 3:23)

-   God is Just

-   For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
    in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Ro 6:23)

-   God is Merciful

-   But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were
    still sinners, Christ died for us. (Ro 5:8)

-   Our Response

-   If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your
    heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. (Ro
    10:9-10)

***Then What?...Bring His Kingdom to Earth!***

***"This, then, is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed
be your name, your Kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in
heaven.'" (Mt 6:9-10)***

# Slide 3 - **Devo/Prayer - Salvation Made Simple**

-   For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
    in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Ro 6:23)

-   God is Merciful

-   But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were
    still sinners, Christ died for us. (Ro 5:8)

-   Our Response to His Offer

-   If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your
    heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. (Ro

# Slide 4 - **Devo/Prayer**

-   Trinity in simple Prof Olson terms

-   God the Father IS love

-   God the Son DEMONSTRATED that love

-   God the Holy Spirit is His love LIVING WITHIN us...

-   God as a person - the Holy Spirit in me

-   "And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to
    help you and be with you forever---the Spirit of truth." John 14:16

One of the things we have been reminded of is that this is not the way
it was supposed to be - with death, sickness and disease. This isn't the
way that God made the world - and it is not the way it will always be.
This is but a "blink" in eternity. We know there is a time when there
will be no more death or disease. And we know that if this should be the
end of Ethan's time here on earth, because of Christ, we are a people
who grieve with the hope that all will be made right and all will be
made whole.

"Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those
who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind,
who have no hope."

1 Thessalonians 4:13 NIV

# Slide 9 - **Metallic Crystal Structures**

-   Tend to be densely packed

\- Typically, only one element is present, so all atomic

radii are the same (except for alloys)

\- Metallic bonding is nondirectional

\- Nearest neighbor distances tend to be small (equilibrium spacing)

\- Electron cloud shields cores from each other

-   Metals have the simplest crystal structures

-   Common among practical materials (elements, alloys)

# Slide 26 - **Polycrystals**

-   Most engineering materials are polycrystals.

-   Nb-Hf-W plate with an electron beam weld

-   Each "grain" is a single crystal

-   If grains are randomly oriented,

overall component properties are not directional

-   Grain sizes typically range from 1 nm to 2 cm

(i.e., from a few to millions of atomic layers).

# Slide 38 - **Drawing HCP Crystallographic Directions (Miller-Bravais coordinates)**

**Steps:**

1. Remove brackets 2. Divide by largest integer so all values are ≤ 1

3\. Multiply terms by appropriate unit cell dimension *a* (for *a* 1,
*a* 2, and *a* 3 axes) or *c*(for *z*-axis *)* to produce projections
4. Construct vector by placing tail at origin and stepping off these
projections to locate the head

# Slide 45 - **Summary**

-   Atoms may assemble into crystalline or

amorphous structures.

-   We can predict the density of a material, provided we

know the atomic weight, atomic radius, and crystal

geometry (e.g., FCC, BCC, HCP).

-   Common metallic crystal structures are FCC, BCC, and

HCP. Coordination number and atomic packing factor

are the same for both FCC and HCP crystal structures.

-   Crystallographic points, directions and planes are

specified in terms of indexing schemes.

Crystallographic directions and planes are related

to atomic linear densities and planar densities.

# Slide 46 - **Summary**

-   Some materials can have more than one crystal

structure. This is referred to as polymorphism (or

allotropy).

-   Materials can be single crystals or polycrystalline.

Material properties generally vary with single crystal

orientation (i.e., they are anisotropic), but are generally

non-directional (i.e., they are isotropic) in polycrystals

with randomly oriented grains.

-   X-ray diffraction is used for crystal structure and

interplanar spacing determinations.
