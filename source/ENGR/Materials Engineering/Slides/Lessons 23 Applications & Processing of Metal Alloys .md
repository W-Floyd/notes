# Slide 4 - **Easter - It's More Than You Think**

***In Jesus, God Frees Us From the Guilt, Condemnation, & Power of
Sin...***

"But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our
iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on Him, and by His
wounds we are healed."

**Isaiah 53:5**

"Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at
her."

"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" "No one, sir," she
said. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave
your life of sin."

**John 8:7, 10-11**

# Slide 5 - **Veteran's Day Prayer**

## **"Lord hear our cry"**

## Natl Day of Prayer Experience

## **"If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."**

## **2 Chronicles 7:14**

# Slide 6 - **Devo/Prayer - Faith: God's Part & Our Part**

## "Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me." Then Jesus said to him, **"Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."**  At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.

## John 5:7-9

CASTING

-   Casting- mold is filled with molten metal

-   metal melted in furnace, perhaps alloying elements added, then cast
    in a mold

-   common and inexpensive

-   gives good production of shapes

-   weaker products, internal defects

-   good option for brittle materials

Annealing: Heat to *T* anneal, then cool slowly.

Based on discussion in Section 11.7, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e*.

Types of

Annealing

-   

Process Anneal:

Negate effects of

cold working by

(recovery/

recrystallization)

-   

Stress Relief: Reduce

stresses resulting from:

\- plastic deformation

\- nonuniform cooling

\- phase transform.

-   

Normalize

(steels): Deform

steel with large grains. Then heat

treat to allow recrystallization

and formation of smaller grains.

-   

Full Anneal

(steels):

Make soft steels for

good forming. Heat

to get

g

, then furnace-cool

to obtain coarse pearlite.

-   

Spheroidize

(steels):

Make very soft steels for

good machining. Heat just

below *T* eutectoid & hold for

15-25 h.

# Slide 34 - **Reason Why Hardness Changes with Distance**

-   The cooling rate decreases with distance from quenched end.

# Slide 35 - **Hardenability vs Alloy Composition**

-   Hardenability curves for

five alloys each with,

*C* = 0.4 wt% C

-   "Alloy Steels"

(4140, 4340, 5140, 8640)

\-- contain Ni, Cr, Mo

(0.2 to 2 wt%)

\-- these elements shift

the "nose" to longer times

(from A to B)

\-- martensite is easier

to form

-   Procedure:

Adapted from Fig. 11.22, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e*.

\-- Pt B: quench to room temp. (retain a solid solution)

\-- Pt C: reheat to nucleate small q particles within a phase.
