# Slide 2 - **Devo/Prayer - First Metallurgist**

-   "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work
    it and keep it." (Gen 2:15)
-   "Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools
    out of ***bronze and iron***." (Gen 4:22)

# Slide 3 - **Devo/Prayer - Security in Christ**

-   "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.  "Have you not put a
    hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have
    blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are
    spread throughout the land. But now stretch out your hand and strike
    everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your
    face."The Lord said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is
    in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger."

## Job 1:9-12

# Slide 4 - **Devo/Prayer**

-   For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor
    demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither
    height nor depth, **nor anything else in all creation, will be able
    to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our
    Lord**.

-   God the Father IS love

-   God the Son DEMONSTRATED that love by dying for my sin

-   God the Holy Spirit is His love LIVING WITHIN me...

-   God as a person - the Holy Spirit in me

-   "And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to
    help you and be with you forever---the Spirit of truth." John 14:16

-   "Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will
    carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."

## Philippians 1:6

-   Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or
    imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be
    glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations,
    for ever and ever!

# Slide 11 - **Dislocations & Strengthening Mechanisms**

**ISSUES TO ADDRESS...**

-   Why are the number of dislocations present

greatest in metals?

-   How are strength and dislocation motion related?

-   Why does heating alter strength and other properties?

-   How can metals be strengthened?

Decrease grain size

Solid solution strengthening

Cold working

Precipitation hardening

![](./Lesson%2011&12%20Dislocations%20&%20Strengthening%20Mechanisms/img10.png)

# Slide 12

**Big Picture**

-   Plastic deformation requires moving of dislocations (edge, screw or
    mixed) in crystal structure

***Anything that hinders dislocation movement through the crystal will
increase the yield strength and hardness of a material***

![](./Lesson%2011&12%20Dislocations%20&%20Strengthening%20Mechanisms/img11.png)

# Slide 13 - **Dislocation Motion**

## Dislocation motion & plastic deformation

-   Metals - plastic deformation occurs by slip - an edge dislocation
    (extra half-plane of atoms) slides over adjacent plane half-planes
    of atoms.

-   If dislocations can't move, plastic deformation doesn't occur!

Adapted from Fig. 7.1, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

![](./Lesson%2011&12%20Dislocations%20&%20Strengthening%20Mechanisms/img12.png)

# Slide 14 - **Dislocation Motion**

-   A dislocation moves along a slip plane in a slip direction
    perpendicular to the dislocation line
-   The slip direction is the same as the Burgers vector direction

**Edge dislocation**

**Screw dislocation**

Adapted from Fig. 7.2, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

# Slide 16 - **Deformation Mechanisms**

## Slip System (where least "atomic distortion" occurs)

-   Slip plane - plane on which easiest slippage occurs

-   Highest planar densities (and large interplanar spacings)

-   Slip directions - directions of movement

-   Highest linear densities

Adapted from Fig. 7.6, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

-   FCC Slip occurs on {111} planes (close-packed) in \<110\> directions
    (close-packed)

-   Condition for dislocation motion:

-   Ease of dislocation motion depends

# Slide 20 - **Example: Deformation of single crystal**

## So the applied stress of 45 MPa will not cause the crystal to yield.

 = 35°

 = 60°

crss = 20.7 MPa

a)  Will the single crystal yield?

b)  If not, what stress is needed?

 = 45 MPa

# Slide 21 - **Example: Deformation of single crystal**

What stress *is* necessary (i.e., what is the yield stress, s *y*)?

So for deformation to occur the applied stress must be greater than or
equal to the yield stress

# Slide 23 - **Four Strategies for Strengthening: 1: Reduce Grain Size**

-   Grain boundaries are

barriers to slip.

-   Barrier "strength"

increases with

Increasing angle of

misorientation.

-   Smaller grain size:

more barriers to slip.

-   Hall-Petch Equation:

# Slide 24 - **Grain Size Influences Properties**

-   Metals having small grains - relatively strong and tough at low
    temperatures
-   Metals having large grains - good creep resistance at relatively
    high temperatures

# Slide 26 - **Four Strategies for Strengthening: 2: Form Solid Solutions**

-   Smaller substitutional

impurity

Impurity generates local stress at **A** and **B** that opposes
dislocation motion to the right.

**A**

**B**

-   Larger substitutional

impurity

Impurity generates local stress at **C** and **D** that opposes
dislocation motion to the right.

**C**

**D**

-   Impurity atoms distort the lattice & generate lattice strains.

-   These strains can act as barriers to dislocation motion.

![](./Lesson%2011&12%20Dislocations%20&%20Strengthening%20Mechanisms/img25.png)

# Slide 27 - **Strengthening by Solid Solution Alloying**

-   Small impurities tend to concentrate at dislocations (create regions
    of tensile strain) - partial cancellation of dislocation and
    impurity atom compressive strains
-   Reduce mobility of dislocations and increase strength

Adapted from Fig. 7.17, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

-   New grains are formed due to energy difference between strained and

\-- Strain-free grains with lower dislocation densities

\-- Small in size

\-- Consume and replace parent cold-worked grains (transition from high
energy to low energy - more stable)

*TR* = recrystallization temperature = temperature at which
recrystallization reaches completion in 1 h

0.3 *Tm \< TR \<* 0.6 *Tm* *Tm = melting temp*

For a specific metal/alloy, *TR* depends on:

-   %CW -- *TR* decreases with increasing %CW
-   Purity of metal -- *TR* decreases with increasing purity

# Slide 47 - **Cold Working vs. Hot Working**

-   Hot working  deformation above *TR*

-   Cold working  deformation below *TR*

# Slide 48 - **Diameter Reduction Procedure - Problem**

A cylindrical rod of brass originally 10 mm (0.39 in) in diameter is to
be cold worked by drawing. The circular cross section (shape) will be
maintained during deformation. A cold-worked tensile strength in excess
of 380 MPa (55,000 psi) and a ductility of at least 15 % *EL* are
desired. Furthermore, the final diameter must be 7.5 mm (0.30 in).
Explain how this may be accomplished.

Stage 1: Cold work - reduce diameter from 10 mm to 8.39 mm

Stage 2: Heat treat (allow recrystallization---nullifies cold work)

# Slide 56 - **Four Strategies for Strengthening: 4: Precipitation Hardening**

-   Hard precipitates form lattice strains which are difficult to shear.

Ex: Ceramics in metals (SiC in Iron or Aluminum).

-   Result: Increase in yield strength

Large shear stress needed

to move dislocation toward

precipitate and shear it.
