# Slide 2 - **Devo/Prayer**

## Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.

## *1 Peter 5:8-9*

## For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him.

## *2 Chronicles 16:9*

# Slide 3 - **Devo/Prayer**

-   I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In
    this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome
    the world. (Jn 16:33)
-   The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting
    arms. (Due 33:27)

# Slide 6 - **Structure & Properties of Ceramics**

**What matters...**

-   How do the crystal structures of ceramic materials differ from those
    for metals?

-   How do point defects in ceramics differ from those defects found in
    metals?

-   How are impurities accommodated in the ceramic lattice?

-   How are the mechanical properties of ceramics measured, and how do
    they differ from those for metals?

-   In what ways are ceramic phase diagrams different from phase
    diagrams for metals?

# Slide 7 - **Types of Materials**

-   Metals: Metallic bonding - sea of electrons

-   Strong/stiff, ductile, usually crystalline

-   High thermal & electrical conductivity

-   Opaque, reflective.

-   Polymers/plastics: Covalent bonding - sharing of electrons

-   Soft, ductile, usually non-crystalline, low strength, low density,
    lower melting temps, high coefficients of thermal expansion

-   Thermal & electrical insulators

-   Optically translucent or transparent.

-   Ceramics: ionic bonding - transfer of electrons

-   Compounds of metallic & non-metallic elements (oxides, carbides,
    nitrides, sulfides)

-   Brittle, glassy

-   Non-conducting (insulators)

-   Composites: combination of two or more individual materials/phases
    to obtain a more desirable combination of properties than can be
    obtained with each individual material (e.g., low density and high
    strength)

![](./Lessons%2024%20Structure%20&%20Properties%20of%20Ceramics%20/img6.png)

# Slide 8 - **Ceramic Characteristics**

-   Compounds between metallic and nonmetallic materials from periodic
    table for which interatomic bonds are **either totally ionic or
    ionic with some covalent character**

-   China, porcelain, bricks, tile

-   Unique properties often achieved through high temp heat treatments
    (firing)

-   Suitable for electronic, computer, comm, and aerospace applications

# Slide 10 - **Ceramic Crystal Structures**

## Oxide structures

-   oxygen anions larger than metal cations
-   close packed oxygen in a lattice (usually FCC)
-   cations fit into interstitial sites among oxygen ions

![](./Lessons%2024%20Structure%20&%20Properties%20of%20Ceramics%20/img9.png)

# Slide 11 - **Atomic Bonding in Ceramics**

-   Bonding: Can be ionic and/or covalent in character.

Adapted from Fig. 2.7, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.* (Fig. 2.7 is adapted
from Linus Pauling, *The Nature of the Chemical Bond*, 3rd edition,
Copyright 1939 and 1940, 3rd edition. Copyright 1960 by

Cornell University.)

-   Degree of ionic character may be large or small:

\-- % ionic character increases with difference in

electronegativity of atoms.

SiC: small

CaF2: large

# Slide 13 - **AX Crystal Structures (Rock Salt, Cesium Chloride, Zinc Blende)**

Adapted from Fig. 12.3, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

Cesium Chloride structure:

 Since 0.732 \< 0.939 \< 1.0, cubic sites preferred

So each Cs+ has 8 neighbor Cl-

Crystal Structures have equal \# of cations & anions (examples: NaCl,
MgO, FeO, CsCl, ZnS, SiC)

![](./Lessons%2024%20Structure%20&%20Properties%20of%20Ceramics%20/img12.png)

# Slide 14 - **Rock Salt Structure**

## Same concepts can be applied to ionic solids in general.

## Example: NaCl (rock salt) structure

*r* Na = 0.102 nm

*r* Na/ *r* Cl = 0.564

-   cations (Na+) prefer octahedral sites

Adapted from Fig. 12.2, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

*r* Cl = 0.181 nm

![](./Lessons%2024%20Structure%20&%20Properties%20of%20Ceramics%20/img13.png)

# Slide 15 - **Bond Hybridization**

## Bond Hybridization is possible when there is significant covalent bonding

-   hybrid electron orbitals form

-   For example for SiC

-   *X* Si = 1.8 and *X* C = 2.5

-   \~ 89% covalent bonding

-   Both Si and C prefer *sp* 3 hybridization

-   Therefore, for SiC, Si atoms occupy tetrahedral sites

![](./Lessons%2024%20Structure%20&%20Properties%20of%20Ceramics%20/img14.png)

# Slide 16 - **MgO and FeO**

O2- *r* O = 0.140 nm

Mg2+ *r* Mg = 0.072 nm

*r* Mg/ *r* O = 0.514

-   cations prefer octahedral sites

So each Mg2+ (or Fe2+) has 6 neighbor oxygen atoms

Adapted from Fig. 12.2, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

MgO and FeO also have the NaCl structure

![](./Lessons%2024%20Structure%20&%20Properties%20of%20Ceramics%20/img15.png)

# Slide 17 - **AmXp Crystal Structures (Flourite)**

    structure)

Adapted from Fig. 12.5, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

Charges on cations & anions are not the same

(m or p ≠ 1), but net charge still zero

(examples: CaF2, UO2, ThO2)

![](./Lessons%2024%20Structure%20&%20Properties%20of%20Ceramics%20/img16.png)

# Slide 18 - **AmBnXp Crystal Structures (Perovskite, Spinel)**

Adapted from Fig. 12.6, *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

would you predict for FeO?

## Why are ceramic materials are more brittle than metals?

-   Consider mechanism of deformation

-   Deformation occurs by dislocation motion; however for highly ionic
    solids, dislocation motion is difficult

-   Few slip systems since ions of like charge resist motion past one
    another
