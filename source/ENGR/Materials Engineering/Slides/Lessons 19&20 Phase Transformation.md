# Slide 11 - **Devo/Prayer - Jesus Calm's the COVID-19 Storm**

## A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. ***Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion***. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?" ***He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!"*** Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?" They were terrified and asked each other, ***\"Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"*** Mark 4:37-41

# Slide 12 - **Devo/Prayer - COVID-19 vs God**

-   **Enemy Strategy (the loser):**

-   "The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that
    they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of
    Christ, who is the image of God." 2 Cor 4:4

-   "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come
    that they may have life, and have it to the full." Jn 10:10

-   **God's Strategy (the winner):**

-   "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish
    what is now being done, the saving of many lives." Gen 50:20

-   **Our Role (be the winner's hands and feet):**

-   Put on the Armor of God (Eph 6:12-18)...PRAY!!!!!

-   "By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you **love
    one another**." Jn 13:35

***In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may
see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. Matthew 5:16***

# Slide 13 - **Strength Through Storms Part 1 (Removing Idols)**

## I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.

## Philippians 4:12

![](./Lessons%2019&20%20Phase%20Transformation/img12.png)

# Slide 14 - **Strength Through Storms Part 2 (Revealing God)**

## My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you, **making your ear attentive** to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, **then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.**

## Proverbs 2:1-5

# Slide 15 - **Strength Through Storms Part 3 (Testing our Faith)**

## In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, so that the proof of your faith, *being* more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

# Slide 19 - **Phase Transformations**

**Why do we care?**

-   Transforming one phase into another takes time.

-   How does the rate of transformation depend on

time and temperature?

-   Is it possible to slow down transformations so that non-equilibrium
    structures are formed?

-   Are the mechanical properties of non-equilibrium

structures more desirable than equilibrium ones?

# Slide 20 - **Solidification: Nucleation Types**

## Nucleation

-   Nuclei (seeds) act as sites on which crystals grow

-   For nucleus to form, the rate of addition of atoms to nucleus must
    be faster than rate of loss

-   Once nucleated, growth proceeds until equilibrium is attained

-   Homogeneous nucleation

-   Nuclei form in the bulk of liquid metal

-   Requires considerable supercooling (typically 80-300ºC)

-   Heterogeneous nucleation

-   Nucleation is easier if stable "nucleating surface" is present ---
    e.g., surface, interface, impurities (common)

-   Requires only very slight supercooling (0.1-10ºC)

![](./Lessons%2019&20%20Phase%20Transformation/img19.png)

# Slide 21 - **Homogeneous Nucleation & Energy Effects**

*r*\\\* = critical nucleus: for *r* \< *r*\\\* nuclei shrink; for *r* \>
*r*\\\* nuclei grow (to reduce energy)

Adapted from Fig.10.2(b), *Callister & Rethwisch 8e.*

D *GT* = Total Free Energy

= D *GS* + D *GV* (free energy req for stable nucleus)

Surface Free Energy - destabilizes

the nuclei (it takes energy to make

an interface)

g = surface tension

Volume (Bulk) Free Energy -

stabilizes the nuclei (releases energy)

D *G\** = Activation Free Energy

![](./Lessons%2019&20%20Phase%20Transformation/img20.png)

# Slide 22 - **Homogeneous Nucleation & Energy Effects**

Note:  *Hf* and  are weakly dependent on  *T*

 *r*\\\* decreases as  *T* increases (greater supercooling)

For typical  *T* *r*\\\* \~ 10 nm

 *Hf* = latent heat of solidification

*Tm* = melting temperature

g = surface free energy

D *T* = *Tm - T* = supercooling

*r\** = critical radius

***Practically, Less Supercooling is Required Since Activation Free
Energy is Lower Due to Heterogeneous Nucleation***

![](./Lessons%2019&20%20Phase%20Transformation/img21.png)

# Slide 23 - **Rate of Phase Transformations**

Kinetics - study of reaction rates of phase transformations (impacts
properties)

-   To determine reaction rate - measure degree of transformation as
    function of time (while holding temp constant)

measure propagation of sound waves - on single specimen

electrical conductivity measurements - on single specimen

X-ray diffraction - many specimens required

How is degree of transformation measured?

# Slide 24 - **Rate of Phase Transformation**

## Avrami equation =\> *y* = 1- exp (- *kt n*)

-   *k* & *n* are transformation specific parameters

# Slide 25 - **Temperature Dependence of Transformation Rate**

-   For the transformation of austenite to pearlite, rate decreases with
    increasing temperature

![](./Lessons%2019&20%20Phase%20Transformation/img24.png)

# Slide 26 - **Practical Rates of Phase Transformation**

-   Equilibrium cooling is impractical (takes too long)

-   Non-equilibrium (metastable) cooling is more common and changes
    transformation temp TE

-   Supercooling: decreases TE by 10-20 deg C

-   Superheating: increases TE by 10-20 dec C

-   Driving force to nucleate increases as we increase  *T*

-   Small supercooling  slow nucleation rate - few nuclei - large
    crystals

-   Large supercooling  rapid nucleation rate - many nuclei - small
    crystals

# Slide 35 - **Tempered Martensite**

-   Tempered martensite less brittle than martensite

-   Tempering reduces internal stresses caused by quenching

Tempering decreases *TS &* *YS,* but increases %EL

-   

Tempering produces extremely small Fe3C particles surrounded by a.

# Slide 37 - **Isothermal Heat Treatment Example (hypereutectoid steel)**

## For a 1.13wt% C iron-carbon alloy, sketch and label time-temperature paths to produce the following microstructures:

-   6.2% proeutectoid cementite and 93.8% course pearlite
-   50% fine pearlite and 50% bainite
-   100% martensite
-   100% tempered martensite

![](./Lessons%2019&20%20Phase%20Transformation/img36.png)

# Slide 38

-   6.2% proeutectoid cementite and 93.8% course pearlite.

Note the placement of pearlite in the graph, between 575 degrees and
730.

Because we want the pearlite to be coarse, we will use a hotter
temperature.

![](./Lessons%2019&20%20Phase%20Transformation/img37.png)

# Slide 39

b)  50% fine pearlite and 50% bainite.

Because we want fine pearlite, we want a fairly low temperature still
within pearlite range.

Once the austenite becomes 50% pearlite, cool again. Remaining austenite
becomes bainite, making 50% fine pearlite and 50% bainite.

![](./Lessons%2019&20%20Phase%20Transformation/img38.png)

# Slide 40

c)  100% martensite

d)  100% tempered martensite

Martensite is marked by the orange lines.

Because we want 100% martensite without any of the austenite becoming
pearlite or bainite, we cool it pretty rapidly.

Tempered martensite is heat treated martensite.

The temperature to which the martensite is heated depends on desired
properties of the tempered martensite.

-   Two samples of A36 steel were heated by oxy-fuel torch until glowing
    red hot (\~1000oC)---each heated from a single point which caused
    two distinct zones to form

-   Direct heating zone: Heated directly by the torch, longer time at
    high temperature

-   Conduction heating zone: Not heated directly by the torch, less time
    at high temperature

-   Two different cooling methods

-   One sample was immediately quenched in water

-   One sample was left to cool in air
