# Problem Statement

Which of the following polymer(s) would be suitable for the fabrication of cups to contain hot coffee:
polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), PET polyester, and polycarbonate. Why?

# Solution

The maximum temperature required will be $100^\circ \text{C}$, due to boiling water.

From Table 15.2 and from the list provided, only **Polycarbonate** fits this criteria for having a glass transition temperature of $100^\circ \text{C}$ or greater

From 15.2, **Polystyrene** wold also work.
