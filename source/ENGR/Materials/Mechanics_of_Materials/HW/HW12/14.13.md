# Problem Statement

Compare thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers

a. on the basis of mechanical characteristics upon heating and
b. according to possible molecular structures.

# Solution

a.  
**Thermoplastic** polymers soften when hot and harden when cool.  
**Thermosetting** polymers, if heated and hardened, will not soften once again due to heat.

b.  
**Thermoplastic** polymers have linear and branched structures.  
**Thermosetting** polymers have crosslinked and network structures.
