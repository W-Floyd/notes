# Slide 11 - **Predeformation by Drawing**

- Drawing…(ex: monofilament fishline)

  - Stretches the polymer prior to use

  - Aligns chains in the stretching direction

- Results of drawing:

  - Increases the elastic modulus ( _E_) in the

stretching direction

    * Increases the tensile strength ( _TS_) in the

stretching direction

    * Decreases ductility (% _EL_)

- Annealing after drawing...

      * Decreases chain alignment

      * Reverses effects of drawing (reduces _E_ and

  _TS_, enhances %EL)

- Similar to effects of cold working in metals

  - Ductile
  - Soften w/heating
  - Polyethylene  
    Polypropylene

  - Significant crosslinking (10 to 50% of repeat units)
  - Hard and brittle
  - Do NOT soften w/heating
  - Vulcanized rubber, epoxies, polyester resin, phenolic resin

# Slide 16 - **Melting & Glass Transition Temps**

## What factors affect _Tm_ and _Tg_?

- Both _Tm and Tg_ increase with increasing chain stiffness
- Chain stiffness increased by presence of

- Bulky sidegroups
- Polar groups or sidegroups
- Chain double bonds and aromatic chain groups

- Regularity of repeat unit arrangements - affects _Tm_ only

# Slide 20 - **Polymer Processing - Thermoplastic vs Thermoset**

- Thermoplastic

- Can be reversibly cooled & reheated, i.e. recycled
- Heat until soft, shape as desired, then cool
- ex: polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene.

- Thermoset

- When heated forms a molecular network
  (chemical reaction)
- Degrades (doesn’t melt) when heated
- A prepolymer molded into desired shape, then
  chemical reaction occurs
- ex: urethane, epoxy

- Fiber characteristics:

- high tensile strengths
- high degrees of crystallinity
- structures containing polar groups

- Formed by spinning

- extrude polymer through a spinneret (a die
  containing many small orifices)

Fig. 15.24, _Callister & Rethwisch 8e_. (Fig. 15.24 is from F.W. Billmeyer, Jr., _Textbook of Polymer Science,_ 2nd edition, John Wiley & Sons, 1971.)

Thermoplastics and some thermosets

- When ram retracts, plastic pellets drop from hopper into barrel
- Ram forces plastic into the heating chamber (around the spreader) where the plastic melts as it moves forward
- Molten plastic is forced under pressure (injected) into the mold cavity where it assumes the shape of the mold
