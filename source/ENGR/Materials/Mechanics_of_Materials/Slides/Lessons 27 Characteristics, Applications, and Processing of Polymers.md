# Slide 2 - **Devo/Prayer**

## **Rejoice** in the Lord always. I will say it again: **Rejoice!** Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. **Do not be anxious** about anything, but in every situation, by **prayer and petition**, with **thanksgiving**, present your requests to God.  And the **peace of God**, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

## **Philippians 4:4-7**

## Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that **the testing of your faith produces perseverance**. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.

## **James 1:2-4**

# Slide 3 - **Devo/Prayer – Wearing God’s Armor**

## Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.

## 1 Peter 5:8-9

## For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him.

## 2 Chronicles 16:9

## Since the children have flesh and blood, He too shared in their humanity so **that by His death He might break the power of him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil**

## Hebrews 2:14

## Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.  Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.

# Slide 10 - **Predeformation by Drawing**

<number>

• Drawing…(ex: monofilament fishline)

\-\- Stretches the polymer prior to use

\-\- Aligns chains in the stretching direction

• Results of drawing:

\-\- Increases the elastic modulus ( _E_) in the

stretching direction

\-\- Increases the tensile strength ( _TS_) in the

stretching direction

\-\- Decreases ductility (% _EL_)

• Annealing after drawing...

\-\- Decreases chain alignment

\-\- Reverses effects of drawing (reduces _E_ and
_TS_, enhances %EL)

• Similar to effects of cold working in metals

Adapted from Fig. 15.13, _Callister & Rethwisch 8e_. (Fig. 15.13 is from J.M. Schultz, _Polymer Materials Science_, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1974, pp. 500-501.)

     (chemical reaction)
-  Degrades (doesn’t melt) when heated
-  A prepolymer molded into desired shape, then
     chemical reaction occurs

Thermoplastics and some thermosets

- When ram retracts, plastic pellets drop from hopper into barrel
- Ram forces plastic into the heating chamber (around the spreader) where the plastic melts as it moves forward
- Molten plastic is forced under pressure (injected) into the mold cavity where it assumes the shape of the mold
