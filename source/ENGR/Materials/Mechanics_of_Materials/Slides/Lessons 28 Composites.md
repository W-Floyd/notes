# Slide 3 - **Devo/Prayer**

## Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant **brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus**, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

## **Philippians 4:4-7**

## Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.

## **Romans 8:38-39**

# Slide 4 - **Devo/Prayer – Committing Finals to the Lord**

## Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.

## **1 Peter 5:6-7**

## Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters.

## **Colossians 3:23**

## Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.“

## **Mark 10:27**

# Slide 7 - **Composites**

**Why it Matters...**

* What are the classes and types of composites?

* What are the advantages of using composite
materials?

* How do we predict the stiffness and strength of the
various types of composites?

![](./Lessons\ 28\ Composites/img6.png)


# Slide 8 - **Types of Materials**

- Metals: Metallic bonding – sea of electrons

- Strong/stiff, ductile, usually crystalline
- High thermal & electrical conductivity
- Opaque, reflective.

- Polymers/plastics: Covalent bonding – sharing of electrons

- Soft, ductile, usually non-crystalline, low strength, low density, lower melting temps, high coefficients of thermal expansion
- Thermal & electrical insulators
- Optically translucent or transparent.

- Ceramics: ionic bonding – transfer of electrons

- Compounds of metallic & non-metallic elements (oxides, carbides, nitrides, sulfides)
- Brittle, glassy
- Non-conducting (insulators)

- Composites: combination of two or more individual materials/phases to obtain a more desirable combination of properties than can be obtained with each individual material (e.g., low density and high strength)

![](./Lessons\ 28\ Composites/img7.png)


# Slide 9 - **Composite Definition**

- Combination of two or more individual materials/phases
- Design goal: obtain a more desirable combination of properties than can be obtained with each individual material

- e.g., low density and high strength

# Slide 15 - **Classification: Particle-Reinforced (cont)**

Concrete – gravel + sand + cement + water

\- Why sand _and_ gravel? Sand fills voids between gravel particles

Reinforced concrete – Reinforce with steel rebar or remesh
\- Increases strength - even if cement matrix is cracked

Prestressed concrete
\- Rebar/remesh placed under tension during setting of concrete
\- Release of tension after setting places concrete in a state of compression
\- To fracture concrete, applied tensile stress must exceed this
compressive stress

# Slide 28 - **Composite Production Methods**

- Filament Winding

- Continuous reinforcing fibers are accurately positioned in a predetermined pattern to form a hollow (usually cylindrical) shape
- Fibers are fed through a resin bath to impregnate with thermosetting resin
- Impregnated fibers are continuously wound (typically automatically) onto a mandrel
- After appropriate number of layers added, curing is carried out either in an oven or at room temperature
- The mandrel is removed to give the final product

Adapted from Fig. 16.15, _Callister & Rethwisch 8e_. [Fig. 16.15 is from N. L. Hancox, (Editor), _Fibre Composite Hybrid Materials,_ The Macmillan Company, New York, 1981.]

# Slide 29 - **Composite Production Methods**

## Pultrusion

- Continuous fibers pulled through resin tank to impregnate fibers with thermosetting resin
- Impregnated fibers pass through steel die that preforms to the desired shape
- Preformed stock passes through a curing die that is

- precision machined to impart final shape
- heated to initiate curing of the resin matrix
