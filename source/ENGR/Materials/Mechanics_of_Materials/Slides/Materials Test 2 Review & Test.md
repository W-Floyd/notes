# Slide 17 - **Summary – Mechanical Properties of Metals**

• Stress and strain: These are size-independent

measures of load and displacement, respectively.

• Elastic behavior: This reversible behavior often

shows a linear relation between stress and strain.

To minimize deformation, select a material with a

large elastic modulus ( _E_ or _G_).

• Toughness: The energy needed to break a unit

volume of material.

• Ductility: The plastic strain at failure.

• Plastic behavior: This permanent deformation

behavior occurs when the tensile (or compressive)

uniaxial stress reaches s _y_.

# Slide 21 - **Summary – Dislocations & Strengthening Mechanisms**

• Dislocations are observed primarily in metals and alloys.

• Strength is increased by making dislocation motion difficult.

• Strength of metals may be increased by:

\-\- decreasing grain size

\-\- solid solution strengthening

\-\- cold working

\-\- precipitate hardening

• A cold-worked metal that is heat treated may experience

recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth – its properties

will be altered.

![](./Materials\ Test\ 2\ Review\ &\ Test/img20.png)

# Slide 22

**Big Picture**

• Plastic deformation requires moving of dislocations (edge, screw or mixed) in crystal structure

_**Anything that hinders dislocation movement through the crystal will increase the yield strength and hardness of a material**_

![](./Materials\ Test\ 2\ Review\ &\ Test/img21.png)


# Slide 23 - **Deformation Mechanisms**

## Slip System (where least “atomic distortion” occurs)

- Slip plane - plane on which easiest slippage occurs

- Highest planar densities (and large interplanar spacings)

- Slip directions - directions of movement

- Highest linear densities

Adapted from Fig. 7.6, _Callister & Rethwisch 8e._

-  FCC Slip occurs on {111} planes (close-packed) in <110>
     directions (close-packed)

=\> total of 12 slip systems in FCC

-  For BCC & HCP there are fewer slip systems.

![](./Materials\ Test\ 2\ Review\ &\ Test/img22.png)


# Slide 24 - **Dislocation Motion/Plastic Deformation**

- Plastic deformation occurs as dislocations move along slip planes in slip directions perpendicular to the dislocation line
- The slip direction is the same as the Burgers vector direction for edge dislocation and perpendicular for screw

**Edge dislocation**

**Screw dislocation**

# Slide 33 - **Summary – Failure**

• Sharp corners produce large stress concentrations

and premature failure.

• Engineering materials not as strong as predicted by theory

• Flaws act as stress concentrators that cause failure at

stresses lower than theoretical values.

• Failure type depends on _T_ and _s_:

-  For simple fracture (noncyclic _s_ and _T_ < 0.4 _Tm)_, failure stress

decreases with:

\- Increased maximum flaw size

\- Decreased _T_

\- Increased rate of loading

\- For fatigue (cyclic _s_):

\- Cycles to fail decreases as D _s_ increases.

\- For creep ( _T_ \> 0.4 _Tm_):

\- Time to rupture decreases as _s_ or _T_ increases.

• Larger grains resist creep better

_**A cylindrical specimen of steel having a diameter of 15.2 mm (0.60 in.) and length of 250 mm (10.0 in.) is deformed elastically in tension with a force of 48,900 N (11,000 lbf). Using the data contained in Table 6.1, determine the following:**_

_**a) The amount by which this specimen will elongate in the direction of the applied stress.**_

_**b) The change in diameter of the specimen. Will the diameter increase or decrease?**_

_**A cylindrical specimen of cold-worked copper has a ductility (%EL) of 15%.**_

- _**How much cold work was done?**_

- _**If its cold-worked radius is 6.4 mm (0.25 in.), what was its radius before deformation?**_

- _**What is it’s Yield Strength?**_

- _**If yielding cannot occur, what would be the critical working stress for a Factor of Safety of 3?**_

- _**After cold work it is 7 in long. How much can it be stretched before failure?**_
