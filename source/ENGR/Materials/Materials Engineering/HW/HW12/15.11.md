# Problem Statement

For thermoplastic polymers, cite five factors that favor brittle fracture.

# Solution

1. Reduction in temperature
2. Increase in strain rate
3. Crack formation points (sharp corners, notches)
4. Increase in specimen thickness
5. Changes to polymer structure that raise glass transition temperature.
