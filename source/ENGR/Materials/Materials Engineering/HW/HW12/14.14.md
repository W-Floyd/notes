# Problem Statement

(a) Is it possible to grind up and reuse phenol-formaldehyde? Why or why not?
(b) Is it possible to grind up and reuse polypropylene? Why or why not?

# Solution

a) **No** it is **not** possible, as it is a *thermosetting* polymer, and once networked cannot be reused.
b) **Yes** it **is** possible, as it is a thermoplastic, which will soften when heated and may be reformed.
