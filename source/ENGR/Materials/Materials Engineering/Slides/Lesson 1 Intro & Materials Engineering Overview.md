# Slide 28 - **Types of Materials**

- Metals: Metallic bonding - sea of electrons

- Strong/stiff, ductile, usually crystalline
- High thermal & electrical conductivity
- Opaque, reflective

- Polymers/plastics: Covalent bonding - sharing of electrons

- Soft, ductile, usually non-crystalline, low strength, low density, lower melting temps, high coefficients of thermal expansion
- Thermal & electrical insulators
- Optically translucent or transparent

- Ceramics: Ionic bonding - transfer of electrons

- Compounds of metallic & non-metallic elements (oxides, carbides, nitrides, sulfides)
- Brittle, glassy
- Non-conducting (insulators)

- Composites: combination of two or more individual materials/phases to obtain a more desirable combination of properties than can be obtained with each individual material (e.g., low density and high strength)

SMART MATERIALS??

# Slide 29 - **The Materials Selection Process**

1.

Pick Application

Determine required Properties

Processing/fabrication: changes _structure_ and overall _shape_

ex: casting, sintering, vapor deposition, doping

forming, joining, annealing, winding/bonding/stacking.

Other factors: availability, cost, durability, reliability, etc

Properties: mechanical, electrical, thermal,

magnetic, optical, deteriorative.

Material: structure, composition.

2.

Properties

Identify candidate Material(s)

3.

Material

Identify required Processing
