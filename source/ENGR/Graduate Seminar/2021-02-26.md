Lesson from Dr.Â Bloom:

The solution was on the shelf, but not on the marketplace - the problem
was solved, it just wasn't deployed.

# Experiment Design

## Key Principles

### Begin with the End in Mind?

1.  What do you want to measure?
    1.  Has the research already been done?
    2.  Is my measurement system in control?
    3.  Is my experiment apparatus reliable? How do I know?
2.  What is my hypothesis?
    1.  Identify and control variables
    2.  Is it falsifiable?
    3.  Can it be tested with data?
    4.  Is it specific and have I controlled for all variables?
3.  What is the desired output of my data?
    1.  Statistical: Provide numerical data to fit an empirical law:
    2.  Theory Validation: Provide numerical data to test a physical
        model, theory, etc.
    3.  Procedure Development: Process variation and testing to meet
        code requirements.

## Tips and Tricks

For how to put data together.

When presenting results, only have idea per slide.

Tell people what you're going to tell them at the top of the slide, give
a summary, then key points, at most two diagrams (image and a graph).

Every presentation is a story, keep it interesting.

Tell them what you'll tell them, tell them, tell them what you told
them.
