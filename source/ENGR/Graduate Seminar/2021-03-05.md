Process is expensive and dangerous, big gap between 1930 and 1980. All
different types of aerogels are emerging now,

# Why polymer aerogels?

Silica aerogels are highly brittle, that's why we must consider
laminated forms in most cases.

One technique proposed was to use silica aerogels with crosslinked
polymers embedded. Doubled the density, but with 300% improvement in
strength. Called x-aerogel when crosslinked.
