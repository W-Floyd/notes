* **Be sensitive to the needs of others**

By slowing down and taking care of other people, I help bring them on board with the plan for the team.
They're not wrong for wanting or needing different things than I do - their fears, concerns, and ideas are valid and worth listening to.
I might even find a better plan this way.

* **Trust others**

Let people prove themselves one way or another before passing judgement - not doing so only stifles their capacity to learn, improve, and contribute in future.
Assume people's intent is good, and I will most often be rewarded.
Trust people to do good work, and don't undermine them when I think I could do better.

* **Be humble, serve others before myself**

My own ambitions are not important - God's plan for my life should be the ultimate goal.
I should not let my own ambitions, plans, and pride get in the way of this.
I must serve God first, then *seek to serve others as God leads me*.

* **Aim for a win-win**

There's no need to "win" over anyone else - everyone can come out better for an interactions.
Again, I need to be mindful of their needs and want.
I can still come out better even if I seek to serve others first - God will be faithful in taking care of me.

* **Be gentle and loving**

A strong personality and drive may inspire some, but without love and kindness it is worthless - I should not let a goal get in the way of seeing God's will be done in my life and in the lives of others through me.
The best way to this end is to be kind and loving, as I too wish to be treated.

* **Be accountable**

I should not let myself get into a situation in which I am not held accountable.
Not only should I position myself in such a way that I may be held accountable, but also that I seek accountability with someone.

* **Be teachable**

I am only human, and I will never be perfect - in fact, I am far from perfect.
I should seek a mentor with someone wiser than myself, who can give good guidance, and speak truth into my life.
In so doing, I provide God another avenue through which He may act and shape my life to fit His will.

* **Set a good example**

Do not slack off, but instead set an example of how I life ought to be lived - enough rest, enough hard work, and enough time spent with God.
If I wish to see others do well on a team with me, I need to be the change I wish to see.

# Summary:

* Love others, and put them above my own selfish ambitions
* Let God lead my steps, and trust in Him to take care of me
* Do good work for the glory of God, not for myself
* Set a good example for others by the way I live and the work that I do
