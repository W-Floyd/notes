#### Adaptable

Always be willing to learn new things and adapt to any given situation.
Be secure in who you are, don't be threatened by change. Embrace
creativity and the chance to try new things, but don't let it become all
about yourself - an adaptable person is not self-centered. Try learning
new things often, taking on new roles that might fit better, and search
for new solutions to problems.

#### Collaborative

Collaboration is the key to overcoming challenges as a team - it is more
than just cooperation, it requires intentional work done together.
Nobody can be doing the minimum to sustain collaboration. Team members
must be seen as collaborators and not competitors, they must be
supportive not suspicious (naturally trusting), and they must be
focussed on the team and not the self. A synergy should be created
through the team, where aspects of each member are complementary to each
others - don't focus on yourself

#### Committed

Committed people persevere in the face of adversity, nor do they depend
on natural giftings - it is a conscious decision to pursue something
wholeheartedly. It can only last when it is based values - without
something to believe in, it is impossible to commit. To improve
commitment, one should strengthen this link to core values. Take risks,
follow through, and check other's commitment also.

# Questions

## What stood out to you as new/unique?

I did not find anything especially new or unique in specific, but the
overall cohesion of the objectives was a fresh perspective to me

## What stood out to as you already knew it, but you often don't do it?

Most of the aspects discussed I already knew, but as before, I struggle
to implement (or struggle to implement concurrently). For example, at
times in my life I have had better discipline than I do now, while I am
currently better in other areas than I have been before.

## What stood out to you as questionable, or you might disagree with it?

Nothing was objectionable, it was all solid guidance.

## What key point(s) or action(s) would make the most positive impact on your leadership (or interpersonal effectiveness) if implemented it?

I believe that improving my communication and relational skills,
dependability, discipline, enthusiasm, and intentionality would most
benefit my impact as a team member and leader.

## Express a personal thought not in the list above.

It is becoming more and more apparent to me that I know what I ought to
do, and yet do not do it. I do appreciate the practical advice given,
and intend to be more intentional about implementing these practices.
