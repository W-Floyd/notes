Most people struggle to achieve inward goal (such as relationships, losing weight, etc.).
Most prior solutions provide only quick fixes.
Character ethics were advocated to be the solution pre-WW2.
Personality ethics, 2 parts (Public Relations Techniques, Positive mental attitude).

# Primary and Secondary Greatness
Personality ethics can be beneficial, but secondary to really building sound relationships of trust with those in our lives.
If all I do is to bolster my image, people will eventually mistrust me (manipulative), that's why personality is secondary to character.
You always reap what you sow.
Character communicates most clearly.
Some people lack communication skills, but we still trust them because they are good people with strong character ethics.
They might not be the slickest speakers, but they can be trusted.

# The power of a paradigm
## How we view the world
Can be looked on as maps.
If wrong, it won't ever lead us to the right place.
Shaped by different elements that also shape our lives
Family, school, church, friends, associates, etc.
Source of attitudes and behaviors, we can't act otherwise.
We all think our worldview is objective.
Reality it isn't.
Often leads to disagreement, clear head is needed to see past this conflict.
We know facts exist, but it gets interpreted by each person according to prior experience.
The more we know what our paradigm is and test it, the more we can listen to other world views, and the more objective our viewpoint becomes.

# The power of a paradigm shift
When it shifts, they experience an "aha" moment.
Not always in the positive direction.
Bring about power change because it's a completely different perspective.
This can happen with life threatening situations or a change in rules.
Change in attitudes and behaviors will only bring an insignificant alteration to our lives.
To see great change, we need to change our basic paradigms.
Our attitude comes from our paradigm, so without that change it won't stick.
We are what we see, so to change this we need to change what we see.
Can to instantaneous or slow.

# Principle-centred paradigm
Some things are natural principles and govern our effectiveness, objective realities.
They come from careful consideration and success of a society.
They're an essential part of human consciousness, but can get numbed.
Fairness, integrity, honest, dignity.
They're different from values (principles that is), guidelines for human conduct.
Personality ethics don't address how life needs a series of steps to be effective, and there can be no shortcuts.

# A new way of thinking
The inside-out approach says we need to work on internals in order to get positive outside results.
Habits are the intersection of knowledge, skill and desire.
The 7 habits in the book are not separate, they are incremental.
Independence is the reaction to dependence.
True independence can be empowering, but keep in mind that we are interdependent by nature.
Only independent people can choose to be interdependent.

# Effectiveness defined
True effectiveness lies in the balance between production and the means of production.
You can't be effective in one without the other.
The assets of production/assets produced are: physical, financial, and human.

# Habit 1: Be Proactive
We need self-awareness to be able to change our paradigms.
Using the view of others around us is misleading.
Self-awareness is more realistic.
Genetic, psychic, and environmental determinism dictate who we becomes.
Our ability to act on self-awareness makes us unique and allows us to break from our circumstances.

## Proactivity Defined
Proactive people determine their own outcomes, reactive people let circumstances govern them.
It is part of human nature, but often dormant.
Proactive people know their situation, and know their power to change it.
They focus on things they are both concerned about and can do something about.
Sometimes these problems can't be solved but managed by our reaction.
Proactive is an inside-out approach.
It takes responsibility for outcomes.

# Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind
Begin each day with a picture of the end of your life and use it to inform all else.
Helps you to focus on what really matters.
One must clearly define the end goal before beginning, not let others dictate our script.

## Centres of Life
We all have a centre, they disturb the harmony of security, guidance, wisdom, and power.
It can be identified by looking at these, though there may be more than one centre.
A good centre is worth more than material things or people.

## The bigger picture
The quality of our script for our lives depends on our ability to be creative and imaginative.
We also require this for imagining wort case scenario responses (visualization and affirmation).
It's good to write your mission statement with roles in your life defined so they can be balanced (this can also work for families and organizations).

# Habit 3: Put First Things First
Is the physical creation of habits 1 and 2.
Self-management is putting first things first through independent will, shown though a commitment in all things including everyday decisions.
This discipline overrides all else.
Effective personal management is spending time on non-urgent but high importance personal tasks (exercise, strengthening relationships).
Often requires saying not to "good but not best" things.
Must select roles, goals for those roles, scheduling time for those goals, then adapt the plan daily.
Key to effective management is delegation - gofer delegation is self-defeating, but stewardship values free will and cares only for the results, not the means.

## Public Victory
Paradigm of Interdependence
Good interdependence needs true independence.
The product/means of production balance is again key, in terms of relationships - it's an emotional bank of trust and favors you build with others.
Small kindnesses go a long way, as do understanding, keeping commitments, clarifying expectations, and sincere apologies.
Every product problem is a means of production opportunity.

# Habit 4: Think Win-Win
Removes unhealthy competition, seeks mutual benefit in all interactions.

## Character and Relationships
Character is the basis for this paradigm, and includes integrity, maturity and abundance mentality as its main traits.
It requires a lot of patience, investment, open communication, and a strong bond of trust.
Key being the relationship, not always a win-win.

# Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, then to be Understood.
Principles of empathic communication
People are usually bad at listening - doing it with the intent to reply, not to understand.
People filter it through their own narrow worldviews.
Empathic listening means to be focussed entirely on understanding the speaker.
It's a great deposit into the emotional bank account.
It is worth the time investment, and worth practicing.

# Habit 6: Synergize
Principles of Creative Cooperation
It is the core of principle-centered leadership, where the whole is greater than the parts.
Value differences, respect them, and build on strengths.
Requires commitment and understanding of people you interact with.
To have synergy with other requires synergy within oneself - the whole brain is working.

# Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw
Your greatest asset is yourself, so take care of it.
Exercise yourself in all ways, physically, mentally, spiritually, and socially.
It is the biggest investment we can make.
Sharpening the saw in one way benefits the other aspect also - it's an upward spiral of growth.
One should affirm others proactivity and responsibility, helping others achieve deeper and more productive relationships.
