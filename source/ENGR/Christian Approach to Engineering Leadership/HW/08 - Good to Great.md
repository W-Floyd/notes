# Summary

#### 1: Good is the enemy of great



#### 2: Level 5 Leadership

<!-- Level 5 Leadership. We were surprised, shocked really, to discover the type of leadership required for turning a good company into a great one. Compared to high-profile leaders with big personalities who make headlines and become celebrities, the good-to-great leaders seem to have come from Mars. Self-effacing, quiet, reserved, even shy --- these leaders are a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will. They are more like Lincoln and Socrates than Patton or Caesar.-->

Level 5 leaders have a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will.
They are not flashy, boastful, or extravagant - instead, they are borderline shy, working quietly to lay the foundation for something greater.
They are not without ambition - instead their ambition is for the company, not for themselves.
Selecting leaders from within a company instead of outside has a greater tendency towards finding Level 5 leaders - many people have the potential to be Level 5 Leaders.

#### 3: First Who ... Then What

<!-- First Who... Then What. We expected that good-to-great leaders would begin by setting a new vision and strategy. We found instead that they first got the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats --- and then they figured out where to drive it. The old adage "People are your most important asset" turns out to be wrong. People are not your most important asset. The right people are. -->

Good to Great leaders focus first on who they have on hand, not selecting people for a specific purpose.
When the goal is the good of the company, and not the individuals, the rest falls into place.
It is a discipline that must be applied rigorously, and constantly.
If a company instead has a genius leader with many helpers, it will all fall apart when the genius leaves.
Instead, a good-to-great leader is thorough, but not without a heart - they don't use layoffs to improve the situation.
A company should limit growth if the right people are not available - sometimes they're just not in the right place.
Finally, use the best people for the best opportunities, not the biggest problems.

#### 4: Confront the Brutal Facts

<!-- Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith). We learned that a former prisoner of war had more to teach us about what it takes to find a path to greatness than most books on corporate strategy. Every good-to-great company embraced what we came to call the Stockdale Paradox: You must maintain unwavering faith that you can and will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties, AND at the same time have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be. -->

Companies that transition from good-to-great are ones that will face difficult facts of their reality.
Truth will make the right decisions self-evident, and so the opportunity to be heard is required in order to see the truth.
Lead with questions, do not coerce people, dissect past problems without blame, and ensure information becomes impossible to ignore.
Face difficulties head on, and keep the faith that you can and will prevail.

#### 5: The Hedgehog Concept

<!-- The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles). To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. Just because something is your core business - just because you've been doing it for years or perhaps even decades --- does not necessarily mean you can be the best in the world at it. And if you cannot be the best in the world at your core business, then your core business absolutely cannot form the basis of a great company. It must be replaced with a simple concept that reflects deep understanding of three intersecting circles. -->

The Hedgehog Concept is the following: Ensure you are working on what you are simultaneously passionate about, can be the best in the world at, and drives your economic engine.
Understand what the company can be the best at, and also what it cannot be the best at.
If your core business is not what you can be the best at, it cannot be the basis for your hedgehog concept.
Sometimes, what you may be the best at may not be what you currently excel at.
Seek to maximize the impact of economic drivers, and put effort into these areas - ensure understanding drives all decisions.

#### 6: A Culture of Discipline

<!-- A Culture of Discipline. All companies have a culture, some companies have discipline, but few companies have a culture of discipline. When you have disciplined people, you don't need hierarchy. When you have disciplined thought, you don't need bureaucracy. When you have disciplined action, you don't need excessive controls. When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great performance. -->

#### 7: Technology Accelerators

<!-- Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. They never use technology as the primary means of igniting a transformation. Yet, paradoxically, they are pioneers in the application of carefully selected technologies. We learned that technology by itself is never a primary, root cause of either greatness or decline. -->

#### 8: The Flywheel and the Doom Loop

<!-- Those who launch revolutions, dramatic change programs, and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap from good to great. No matter how dramatic the end result, the good-to-great transformations never happened in one fell swoop. There was no single defining action, no grand program, no one killer innovation, no solitary lucky break, no miracle moment. Rather, the process resembled relentlessly pushing a giant heavy flywheel in one direction, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of breakthrough, and beyond. -->

#### 9: From Good to Great to Built to Last

<!-- In an ironic twist, I now see Good to Great not as a sequel to Built to Last, but as more of a prequel. This book is about how to turn a good organization into one that produces sustained great results. Built to Last is about how you take a company with great results and turn it into an enduring great company of iconic stature. To make that final shift requires core values and a purpose beyond just making money combined with the key dynamic of preserve the core / stimulate progress. -->

# Questions

## What stood out to you as new/unique?

I found the real world analysis of actual companies to be an eye-opener.
To see how such seemingly mundane and unexciting companies were in fact led by such exceptional leaders is interesting to see.

## What stood out to as you already knew it, but you often don't do it?

Focussing on the people instead of the problem.
I know they are the most important aspect of a team, but it's hard to put them ahead of the issue at hand.

## What stood out to you as questionable, or you might disagree with it?

Nothing stood out as questionable.

## What key point(s) or action(s) would make the most positive impact on your leadership (or interpersonal effectiveness) if implemented it?

I believe that a drive for the good of a company or team will have the greatest impact on my leadership.
To put aside my own pride and work for the good of others would be helpful.

## Express a personal thought not in the list above.

I wonder how the current trend of increasingly celebrity oriented CEO positions will play out (for example, Tesla).
I struggle to believe that many newer companies in the "startup" mindset follow these principles.
