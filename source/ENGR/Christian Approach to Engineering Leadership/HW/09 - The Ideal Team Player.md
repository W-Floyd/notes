# Summary

There a three main attributes of the ideal team player:
* Humble
* Hungry
* Smart

Those that have none of these likely don't even get hired.

## Humble
This is the single most important aspect of a team player.
Those that are humble share the success of the team, not boast about themselves.
This does not mean, however, that they lack confidence in themselves - humility does not mean putting yourself down.
Those that are arrogant lack humility also - one must be careful not to excuse the arrogance for the sake of the good work that some people do.

## Hungry
Those that are hungry are seeking achievement - they want to climb the ranks, perform well, and learn more.
They don't need motivating, and are diligent in what they do.
This hunger, however, must be kept healthy.
It should not become prideful, nor should it consume the person's life - it should instead be a sustainable commitment towards excellence, going above and beyond when required, but not unnecessarily.

## Smart
Not "book smart", but "street smart", it's how to deal with people and situations.
An awareness of what is appropriate, what will get the best result from a group or individual, how to be engaged with other and listen well.
This is socially smart, not knowledge smart.

These characteristics are not innate - they must be worked for, maintained, and cultivated carefully.
People without these three require much more guidance from others.

These three virtues overlap to form a Venn diagram, with the following overlaps segments:

* **Humble Only** - ***The Pawn*** - These people make do on teams that value harmony over getting work done
* **Hungry Only** - ***The Bulldozer*** - These people get things done, but alone - they survive on teams that value only results
* **Smart Only** - ***The Charmer*** - These people survive on teams where their influence is enough to keep them there, they don't contribute or care about others
* **Humble/Hungry** - ***The Accidental Mess-maker*** - These people push ahead, doing their best, but unaware of their actions. These people are easily corrected, however, as they have no malice, only unawareness.
* **Humble/Smart** - ***The Loveable Slacker*** - These people do what they're asked, but nothing more. Because they are likeable, leaders avoid confronting them.
* **Hungry/Smart** - ***Skillful Politician*** - They work hard, but for their own gain. They can fake humility, so damage can go unnoticed until it's too late.
* **Humble/Hungry/Smart** - ***The Ideal Team Player***

These three aspects are spectrums, and won't always fall into one class or another.

When hiring people, the following interview tactics prove helpful:

* don't be generic
* debrief each interview as team
* consider group interviews
* make interviews non-traditional
* ask questions more than once
* ask what others would say
* ask candidates to do some real work
* don't ignore hunches
* scare people with sincerity

when looking at references, the following also prove useful:

* put the reference provider at ease
* look for specifics
* focus on areas of doubt
* pay attention to references that don't respond
* ask what others would say about them

When assessing current employees, the following goals are to be kept in mind:

1. confirm the employee is a team player
2. helping the employee improve to become one
3. deciding to move the employee out

If you can't decide yet, let them keep working until it becomes clear - if you know for sure, act swiftly.
A manager should ask themselves specific questions to determine whether the employee exhibits the three different aspects of a team player.

In order to help develop the employee into a team player, reminding the employee is necessary.
It will be uncomfortable and progress may seem slow, but it is important.
In fact, even team players need continued development.
In order to build up the different aspects, the following may prove useful:

* developing humility
  * identify the root causes of the insecurity
  * exposure therapy
  * leader modeling
* developing hunger
  * connect the person to the importance of their work
  * set clear expectations
  * don't wait to give feedback
  * publicly praise them
  * leader modeling
* developing smarts
  * be brutally honest and let them know what they need to do at the right time

Be explicit and bold, let people know you expect the three aspects of a team player.
Catch and revere, let people know what they did well.
Detect and address, let people know when they aren't following the guidelines.

# Questions

## What stood out to you as new/unique?

Nothing was really new or unique, I've heard this before.

## What stood out to as you already knew it, but you often don't do it?

I struggle with people smarts - I need people to tell me what to do.
I try my best, but it just doesn't come to mind in the moment.

## What stood out to you as questionable, or you might disagree with it?

Nothing stood out as questionable.

## What key point(s) or action(s) would make the most positive impact on your leadership (or interpersonal effectiveness) if you implemented it?

Working on building up my smarts, and asking people to keep me accountable would be most helpful for me.

## Express a personal thought not in the list above.

This seems all very straightforward and uninspiring.
