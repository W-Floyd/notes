# Summary

#### 1: Own the Emotion

Emotional influence requires emotional responsibility.
Don't just blame external events for your emotions - they are your own, and it is up to you as to how you allow the to form.
If you keep blaming anyone but yourself for your own reaction, you will never overcome your own reaction

#### 2: Name the Story

Emotions come from events that happen - you must determine what truly happened to make you feel that way you do.
Really ask what story you're telling, if you're painting yourself as the helpless victim.
Once you see this, you'll also see the other ways in which you could look at the situation.

#### 3: Challenge the Story

Ask yourself questions that provoke yourself out of your own story - to make yourself question if you're really the victim.
See how you could move towards what you really want instead of what fits with your story.
Try asking what you should do instead of defending yourself.

#### 4: Find Your Primal Story

Work to determine what stories you tell yourself in predictable situations, and attempt to break from them.
For example, flaring up under criticism due to parental criticism in the past.
Challenge the idea that your safety or worth are in question in these times, and stay yourself.

# Questions

## What stood out to you as new/unique?

Most of the article was new to me.
Not so much the general idea of working to think clearly, but the step-by-step process of talking yourself through a situation, and knowing what to identify for yourself.
It was refreshing to read.

## What stood out to as you already knew it, but you often don't do it?

I already knew that it is important to not defend myself, but I am very bad at this - my natural instinct is to defend my actions, even when I never thought them through and have no actual backing for them.
I've found this to get in the way of accepting well intended criticism and correction.
I find myself needing to be gently eased into correction.

## What stood out to you as questionable, or you might disagree with it?

Nothing seemed questionable, it appeared to be reasonable.

## What key point(s) or action(s) would make the most positive impact on your leadership (or interpersonal effectiveness) if implemented it?

I believe that practicing slowing myself down and not letting my hurt or surprise get in the way of communication would benefit me most - especially in terms of being corrected or given advise.
Being able to learn from others more readily would help a great deal.

## Express a personal thought not in the list above.

In some ways I feel that I used to be better that keeping a clear head than I am now - perhaps it is that I am more aware of how I react to others, or maybe it is the more frequent social interactions that have brought this to the surface for me.
Maybe it is merely a byproduct of being chronically sleep deprived...
Whatever the case, I feel this would help me greatly in relating to others on a deeper level.
