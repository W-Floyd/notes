# What is Leadership?

## How is it different from management?

Setting an example, directing others in a positive direction, rather
than specific task assignment.

### Other's Thoughts

Leadership is the process by which someone with means and influence
bring others alongside them to accomplish a goal. Management arranges
people and resources to accomplish a goal.

*Personal Note:* We need both - not all good leaders are good at
management.

It's coming alongside and doing it with or before you. Management points
towards what should be done.

Leadership is about getting people aligned with a goal. Management is
about getting specific results to reach a goal.

"You manage things, you lead people." If you try to manage people, you
treat them like "things" instead of people - it's clear we shouldn't do
this.

*Anson Note:* Could we maybe instead of following policy, follow the
intent and goal rather than a policy.

"Give me a couple days" is a whole lot better than a "We'll see".

A good leader will be mindful of treating people like people.

## Think of a leader you like, what do you like about them?

-   Competency in relevant subject matter
    -   Defers/Listen to others who know best
-   Unflappable
    -   It's not that they need to be emotionless, but they should hold
        a confidence that inspires others to follow the example
-   Willingness to admit fault and take responsibility
-   Well organized

### Other's Thoughts

-   A strong relationship with God
-   Trustworthy
-   Can communicate effectively
    -   *Anson Note:* Without followers, they can't be a leader. Without
        communication, you have no followers.
-   Self sacrifice
-   Vulnerability
-   Barely grumble
-   Not double minded
-   Teachability
-   Boldness
-   Being merciful
-   Personable
    -   Relates well to others
-   Intentional
    -   In their relationships
-   Centeredness/Confidence
-   Well rounded
-   Inspiring
-   Loving
    -   Give some hopefulness
    -   It needs to be in your heart as well as your heart.

Can be classed into **Character**, **Competence**, and
**Communication**: Good people who know what they're doing and
communicate with others. It's a three legged school.

The better you get, the worse you realise you were.

# Definitions (Sort of)

## Humble

A sober minded assessment of yourself. It doesn't just mean not being
humble, it also means not thinking so little of yourself that you don't
engage.

## Conflict

You know what it means? You're dealing with people.

# Tidbits

If someone is asking you a stupid question, ask them why they are asking
you that. "That's interesting, why do you ask me that?" "That's
interesting, tell me more."

"My whole life is a string of coping strategies."

# Leadership Philosophy

## Overview

-   Management is out of appointed position - leadership is out of
    personal influence
-   Sincere empathy is essential to gaining the trust and confidence of
    others
-   Trust is earned, it is not given away

## Expectations

-   Consistency helps others know what to expect and what is valued
-   Have clear and reasonable expectations
    -   Care for students, do advising, be approachable, etc.
    -   Hold others accountable,
-   Hold others accountable for clear expectations
-   Accept a few mistakes - give "latitude to learn"

## Personnel Development

-   Empower others to succeed - "synergy of individual initiative"
-   Strong people are an asset, not a threat
-   Help people grow - the same people also help me to grow
-   Reward excellence, correct low performance
    -   If you don't reward good performance, it's not very inspiring

## Differences

-   Professional difference of opinion is good
    -   How do you know what you don't know if you don't have people
        disagree with you
-   Multicultural awareness is essential! Approach differences openly
    and with great respect.
-   Tough decisions or changes need to be well informed by all
    stakeholders. After taking in the diverse perspectives, a decision
    must be made and some people will not like it.
    -   You're never going to make everyone happy.
    -   Compromise if you can, but sometimes it's worse than going with
        one or the other.
    -   "Let's try this, and if it doesn't work out, we can reevaluate
        this" - The scientific method will prevail! It's an idea or
        policy, not a marriage.
-   Work through important issues rather than ignore them
    -   Some things should be ignored, some shouldn't

## Summary

-   Focus on long term success with sufficient short term success
-   Ask questions!
-   Recognize a need, take charge, and take responsibility
-   Work hard and maintain work - life balance
-   Unwaveringly advocate for the success of students, faculty, and
    staff

# Philosophy of Research

1.  Discovery - traditional research / finding new things
2.  Integration - developing a holistic view of concepts from varied
    phenomena or fields
3.  Application - apply known aspects of science and engineering to
    existing problems to more fully utilize the benefits: and
4.  Pedagogy - establishing methods of instruction

# Teaching Philosophy

## Major Goals for My Students

-   Learn the course material

-   Understand the industry relevance of the course material

-   Learn to think critically - question logical inconsistencies

-   Embrace lifelong learning

-   Learn to communicate effectively (groups, writing, presentations)

-   Learn to take personal responsibility (timeliness, quality of work)

If they come in dressed like yesterday and smelling of whiskey, you're
not gonna be very optimistic of their performance.

-   Warn the idle
-   Encourage the timid
-   Help the weak
-   Be patient with everyone

1 Thessalonians 5:14
