# Dependence, independence, and interdependence.
It's how we come into the world, where we want to get to, and what we want to be able to do for others.
Goal is to be able to be independent, so you can transition to being the provider for others.

# P/PC Balance
Be careful to take care of yourself...

# Emotional Bank Account
This works in relationships too.
You do for them what **they** want.

# Habits

## Be Proactive
We are all proactive if we're here - yeah we could do better, but it's an opportunity.
Have a plan.

Put space between Provocation and Response.

### Circle of Concern / Influence
Concern is larger than your circle of influence.
Sometimes there's nothing you can do about them.
How do you say I did what I could?
Am I really doing what I can?

By doing things you **can** do, you an enlarge/shift your circle of influence.
But sometimes, you can't change it.

## Begin with the end in mind
When we're done, how will we know?
We may like and want the outcome, but learn to celebrate the process.

Don't climb the ladder of success to find it leaning on the wrong wall.

Think 50 years down the line, you're with your wife, what is something you want her to say to you?  
Now imagine you're 45, you're in a company, family is in full swing, you sit at dinner, you tell your kids you're proud of them, what do you want them to be proud of you for?  
You're 30, on a date with your wife for your anniversary, what's something you don't want her to say to you?

It's like fitting a curve to data points...

To create your mission statement, if it takes you more than 30 minutes, you'll probably not do it.
Just set some goals, it'll be good enough.

Some people already do this stuff.
Maybe they don't need a book to get after it themselves.

## First Things First

$$
\begin{array}{l|cc}
    \text{Important} & I & II \\
    \text{Not Important} & III & IV \\
    \hline
    & \text{Urgent} & \text{Not Urgent}
\end{array}
$$

### I
* fire
* test
* report

### II
* job hunting
* relationships
* spiritual discipline
* exercise
* discipline
* clean room

### III
* telemarketing
* some homework
* some conversations
* some email
* excessive news

### IV
* games
* social media
* buzz app
* YouTube in excess

### Thoughts

Some things are as important to you as that person is important to you.

II are all the ones that hurt...

### Anson Notes

Get rid of IV, and reduce/delegate III.

## Win-Win

$$
\begin{array}{ll|ccc}
    &\text{High} & 1 & 2 \\
    \text{Courage}&&& \\
    &\text{Low} & 3 & 4 \\
    \hline
    && \text{Low} & & \text{High}\\
    &&& \text{Consideration} &
\end{array}
$$

### 1
#### Win-loose


### 2
#### Win-win or no-deal
Say when you're negotiating a salary, ask for the higher wage, but ask if they feel good about this.

It can be a no-deal on the upgrade, not about the relationship.
You want to preserve the relationship.

Ask if there's something you can do to make it a win for them.

### 3
#### Loose-loose


### 4
#### Loose-win

### Anson note
When it's time for a decision and they're close to agreeing, ask if you can try it and revisit it if it doesn't work out.

Ask more open questions.
Ask what are *some* things a *strong* candidate would have for a job.

Most important is the attitude.

"You're not listening", you weren't internalizing it.
Maybe ask "lets see what I understand"

## Synergize

If you can get more than one thing done at the same time, do it.
Go to lunch with someone rather than meet and eat separate.

## Sharpen the Saw

All the II things.
