# Accountability Partner vs Mentor

An accountability partner is on the path with you, and a mentor has already been down the path.

Pray specifically to find these people wherever you live.

How did he get where he did?
How did someone like him end up having so much power?
He followed God's will - you don't need to try for promotion, you just need to be the person that God wants.

* Is it me, or is it Christ in me?
  * I can do nothing on my own (John 15:5)
  * Commit hard work to the Lord (Col 3:23)
  * Watch what He does through me and give Him the glory (Mk 10:27)
  * God's plan is perfect and He alone promotes (Jer 29:11)
  * Accountability (Eccl 4:12)
  * Caring for God's Temple (1 Cor 3:16)

Caring for God's temple, it's taking care of the body He gave you.
When you're in a position of responsibility, it's important that you take care of your physical body in order.
