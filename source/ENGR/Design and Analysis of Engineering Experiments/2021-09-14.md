# Fisher LSD Test
Assumes similar variance.

# Tukey Test
$p$ is number of treatments, $f$ is degree of freedom of your MSE ($n\cdot (a-1)$)

# Contrasts
Something you introduce to increase the visibility of something you care about.

Orthogonality?

# Summary

## Paris of Treatments

F LSD doesn't control overall risk.

Tukey controls overall risk, but tends to be conservative (towards failing to reject).

## Contrasts

Any linear combinations of treatments.
May be useful for interpolating.

Choose orthogonal if possible.

Scheffe's method for confidence intervals.
