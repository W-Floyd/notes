# Summary so far:

7-step design/experiment process

* Gaussian Distribution
  * t-distribution
  * $\chi^2$ distribution
  * New one: F-ratio distribution

With it, we also have hypotheses tests:

* z-test
* t-test
* $\chi^2$ test
* New one: F-test

Two-sample t-test vs paired t-test

Basic two sample:

Collect data pop 1 and pop 2, then mean of pop1 and pop2, then take and normalize:

$$
t_0 = \frac{\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2}{\frac{s_P}{\sqrt{n_{eq}}}}
$$

$2n-1$ degrees of freedom

Comparing difference of means!

Why use paired as opposed to this?

You're going to take paired samples, find their differences, then find the average of the differences.

$n-1$ degrees of freedom.


Example of why to use paired: Changing tips when testing hardness, you don't want it linked only to one material, so you must vary over different materials, which loses meaning if you take the mean over the dataset instead of the differences between treatments.

Blocking is the generalization of this concept.

# ANOVA
**AN**alysis **O**f **VA**riance

Multiple treatments, want to determine if all these treatments are equivalent.

$H_0$: that all treatments are equivalent.

$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc} 
& \text { Replica 1 } & \cdots & \text { Replica n } \\
\hline \text { Treatment 1 } & y_{11} & & y_{1n} \\
\vdots & \\
\text { Treatment 2 } & y_{a1} & & y_{an}
\end{array}
$$

# Regression

We use an empirical model: Fancy Curve Fitting.

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^k \beta_i \chi_i
$$

This could be any function of the data that you measured other than the response variable.

Start at the smallest order that you think can explain your data, then expand as needed.
Stop expanding once your residuals look nice.

$$
y_i = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & \chi_1 & \cdots & \chi_k
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
    \beta_0 \\
    \beta_1 \\
    \vdots\\
    \beta_k
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
y_i = \vec{X}^T  \vec{\beta}
$$

$$
\vec{y} = X\vec{\beta}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Estimate}&\quad \hat{\vec{\beta}} &= (X^T \vec{X})X^T \vec{y}\\
    \text{Residual}&\quad \hat{\vec{\epsilon}} &= \vec{y} - X\hat{\vec{\beta}}\\
    \text{Population Variance Estimate}&\quad \hat{\sigma}^2 &= \frac{\hat{\vec{\epsilon}}^T \hat{\vec{\epsilon}}}{n-(k+1)} \Leftarrow \left\{ \begin{aligned}
        SS_E &= \hat{\vec{\epsilon}}^T \hat{\vec{\epsilon}}\\
        SS
    \end{aligned} \right.
\end{aligned}

# Project

Initial proposal due next week.

Pick parameters for enclosure, have Sheldon test in order to determine best cooling.
Possibilities are fan size, opening position, rain shroud, exterior coating (paired test, one with and one without with same sunlight).
