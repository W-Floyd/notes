# Problem Statement

Why is randomization important in an experiment?

# Answer

Randomization is important in an experiment so as to avoid systematic bias introduced by the order of runs.
For example, a part on a machine may degrade over time - were all runs of one parameter setting were conducted first, the part wearing out may affect the result of later runs more than the first runs.
This would then bias the results in favor of the first runs (assuming a newer part performs better).
Total randomization means to randomize the order of every variable - this is not always practical, depending on time, budget, or material constraints.
Partial randomization at least may be performed in such cases.
