# Problem Statement

What are the potential risks of a single, large, comprehensive experiment in contrast to a sequential approach?

# Answer

The risks of running a large experiment lies in the experimenter having a poor understanding of the subject (especially if the process is new).
As such, breaking the experiment down into smaller experiments allows the consequences of incorrect assumptions to be minimized.
The experimenter may then design later experiments based on the knowledge found in these smaller scale experiments, getting to the desired questions more quickly, cheaper, and using less resources.
