# Problem Statement

What is replication? Why do we need replication in an experiment? Present an example that illustrates the differences between replication and repeated measures.

# Answer

Replication means to run an experiment multiple times with identical setup, including resetting all input variables even if unchanged from prior runs.
Each run is called a replicate.
Replication is necessary in an experiment in order to ensure that potential outlier values are not perceived as true, and so this variability may be quantified.

The distinction from repeated measurements is that repeated measurements are from within a single run, even if the run produces a batch of product.
For example, the thickness of a sheet of paper as measured from a single ream of paper is considered to be repeated measurements (so long as the ream is from the same replicate), even though multiple pages are sampled.
