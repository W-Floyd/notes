# Regression Fitting

Come up with math. model that describes trends in data - it's an empirical model, as it does not know the reason for things, it is just a "good enough" fit.

Regression models are really useful because they can describe without fully understanding it.

**Even though your regression model is nonlinear in the data, it is still linear in the parameters.**
This is important as we can still use Linear Algebra, as it makes it much easier to estimate your parameters.
It allows us to create a matrix form that is much easier to solve.

$$
y_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{11} \beta_2 x_{12} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{1k}
$$

$\beta_{1,2,\ldots k}$: Indices of regression coefficients which correspond to the levels of your factors and the functions thereof.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    y_i &: \text{response variable/measurement}\\
    x_{ij} &: i^{\text{th}} \text{ level of the } j^{\text{th}} \text{ factor or function of factors.}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l|l|l}
\dot{m} & d & c_0 \\
\hline x_{11} & x_{12} & y_1 \\
\hline \ldots & \ldots & \ldots \\
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \vec{\beta} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \beta_0\\
        \beta_1\\
        \vdots\\
        \beta_k
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
y_1 = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1k}
\end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{X}_1} \vec{\beta}
$$

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}
    \vec{X}_1\\
    \vec{X}_2\\
    \vec{X}_3\\
    \vdots\\
    \vec{X}_n\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
n\times (k+1)
$$

$$
\vec{y} = X \vec{\beta} + \vec{\epsilon}
$$

$$
n \geq k+1
$$

$$
SS_{\text{Treat}} = \vec{\beta}^T \vec{\beta}
$$

$$
df_\text{\text{Treat}} = k
$$

$$
F_0 = \left(\frac{\hat{\vec{\beta}}^T\hat{\beta}}{k}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\frac{\hat{\vec{\epsilon}}^T\hat{\vec{\epsilon}}}{n-(k+1)}}\right)
$$

Residual is the measurement minus the fit.
