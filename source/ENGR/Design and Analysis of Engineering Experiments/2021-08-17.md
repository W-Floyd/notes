Homework assigned on Thursday and collected next Thursday.
Worth 10% of course grade, no late credit.

Exams:

* 2 exams
* take home, open book, open note
* **Exams taken directly from homework**

Project, each student will develop experiments based on own work.

***

# Identify root cause of problems

* A problem exists
  * semicond. yield is down
  * design alternatives exist
  * interactions of medicines are unknown at various concentrations
* Design of experiments offers tools to determine which factors at the root cause of the problem.
  * We want to go through process to find factors that we care about, which ones may influence, and then design experiment to determine their impact.
* LeTourneau example: Rocket Stove Design
  * Metric: efficiency of stove
  * Factors: chimney geometry and gasification method
  * Build prototypes of each geometry
  * Collected data
  * Determined which factors significantly improved stove performance

# Engineering Experiments

* Reduce *time* to design/develop new products and processes
* Improve *performance* of existing processes
* Improve *reliability* and performance of products
* Achieve product and process *robustness*
* *Evaluation* of materials, design alternatives, *setting* component and system tolerances, etc.

Consider for process:

* inputs
* outputs
* factors
  * controllable
    * e.g. stock feed rate
  * uncontrollable
    * ambient temperature and humidity when outside
    * can we even measure it, or am I in the dark?

When analyzing process or design, consider all catagories of known unknowns, etc.
Must figure these out to know what's influencing system.

Example: Office is way too hot.
From thermostat in office that is not in use, so stays cold.

# Definition and Illustration of Terms

Design experiments to maximize meaningful information from fixes resources.

* Blocking isolates sources of variance to improve measurement of primary factors
  * We don't just want data, we want information!
* Factorial Designs reduce the number of experiments, saving precious resources
  * We want to arrive at confidence with a set number of passes


## Blocking

How to deal with things that cause variance that we don't care about.
Maybe not a factor you care about or control.

Blocking groups data to where factor is held constant, so single block can be analyzed without lumping together.
Allows isolation of sources of variance.

## Factorial Design

Reduces total number of experiments, find primary factors and how they interact.

The design part of Engineering Design and Analysis is to find what to collect, then extract meaningful information from that.

***

Demystify the statistical skills to extract actionable intelligence from designed experiments

* Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) identifies most important factors
* Regression created models useful for prediction and control.

# Introduction to DOX

## Experiment

* An **experiment** is a test or series of tests.
* Experiments are used widely in the engineering world
  * Process characterization and optimization
  * Evaluation of material properties
  * Product design and development
  * Component and system tolerance determination
* "All experiments are designed experiments, some are poorly designed, some are well-designed"

* Randomization
  * Running the trials in an experiment in random order.
    * Balances effects due to duration of experiment, changes to to repeated use, etc.
    * Helps deal with unknown unknowns
  * Notation of balancing out effects of "lurking" variables
* Replication
  * Sample size (improving precisions of effect estimation, estimation of error or background noise)
  * Replication versus repeat measurements? (see page 13)
* Blocking
  * Dealing with (isolating) nuisance factors

# Strategy of Experimentaiton

* "Best-guess" experiments
  * Used a lot
  * More successful than you might suspect, but there are disadvantages...
* One-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiments
  * Sometimes associated with the "scientific" or "engineering" method.
  * Devastated by interaction, also very inefficient
* Factorial experiments
  * TODO: Missed this

Project will be to apply steps to senior design project.

# Planning, Conducting and Analyzing an Experiment

1. Recognition of and statement of problem
2. Choice of factors, levels, and ranges
3. Selection of the response variable(s)
4. Choice of design
5. Conducting the experiment
6. Statistical analysis
7. Drawing conclusions, recommendations

* Get **statistical thinking** involved early
* Your **non-statistical** (domain) knowledge is crucial to success
  * Knowing your subject matter let you know what to analyse
* Pre-experimental planning (steps 1-3) vital
* Think and **experiment** sequentially
* TODO: Fill this out, missed it.
