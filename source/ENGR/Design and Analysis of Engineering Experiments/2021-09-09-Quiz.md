1. For an experiment with 5 treatments and 4 replicas:
    a. How many degrees of freedom are there for the treatments?  
       4 degrees of freedom
    b. How many degrees of freedom are there for the error?  
       
    c. How many total degrees of freedom are there?  
       
2. $SS_T =  + $
3. $MS_E =  $
4. $MS_\text{Treatments} = $
5. $F_0 = $
6. What is the distribution of $F_0$?

    Gaussian/Normal

7. We reject the null hypothesis when $F_0$ is:
