# Probability Distributions

## Random variables and their distributions

- **Random variables** (RVs) are (loosely) functions that map the results of an experiment to real numbers, e.g.
  - The sum of two dice
  - An estimate of Young's modulus from stress-strain data
- A **realization** of a random variable is a particular value taken on by a random variable,
e.g.
  - 7
  - $205.7 \mathrm{~GPa}$
- RVs are the concept, realizations are particular values
- **Discrete random variables** take on finitely many or countably infinitely many values, e.g.
  - $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
  - The integers
  - The rational numbers
- **Continuous random variables** take on uncountably infinitely many variables over a continuum, e.g.
  - The interval $[0,1]$
  - The real numbers

## Probability distributions defined

- A probability distribution describes the likelihood that a **random variable** takes on values within a given interval or specific value
- Discrete RVs have a **Probability Mass Function** (PMF) that describes the probability that the RV takes on a particular value, denoted 
  - $f_{X}(x)=P(X=x)$
- A **Cumulative Distribution Function** (CDF) is the probability that an RV is less than or equal to a particular value, denoted
  - $F_{X}(x)=P(X \leq x)$
- For complicated mathematical reasons, continuous RVs have **Probability Density Functions** (PDFs)
  - $f_{X}(x)=\frac{d F_{X}(x)}{d x}$
- Continuous RVs only have positive probabilities over intervals.
