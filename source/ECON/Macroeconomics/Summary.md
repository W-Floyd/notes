## Key Points

-   Economists use the standard of economic efficiency to assess the
    desirability of economic outcomes. Efficiency requires
    1.  that all actions generating more benefit than cost be
        undertaken, and
    2.  that no actions generating more cost than benefit be undertaken.
-   Although perfection is a noble goal, it is rarely worth achieving
    because additional time and resources devoted to an activity
    generally yield smaller and smaller benefits and cost more and more.
    Inefficiency can result when either too little or too much effort is
    put into an activity.
-   Governments can enhance economic well-being by performing both
    protective and productive functions. The protective function
    involves
    1.  the protection of individuals and their property against
        aggression and
    2.  the provision of a legal system for the enforcement of contracts
        and settlement of disputes. The productive function of
        government can help people obtain goods that would be difficult
        to supply through markets.
-   When markets fail to meet the conditions for ideal economic
    efficiency, the problem can generally be traced to one of four
    sources: absence of competition, externalities, public goods, or
    poor information.
-   Externalities reflect a lack of fully defined and enforced property
    rights. When external costs are present, output can be too large --
    units are produced even though their costs exceed the benefits they
    generate. In contrast, external benefits can lead to an output that
    is too small -- some units are not produced even though the benefits
    of doing so would exceed the cost.
-   Public goods are goods for which
    1.  rivalry in consumption is absent and
    2.  it is difficult to exclude those who do not pay. Because of the
        difficulties involved in establishing a one-to-one link between
        payment and receipt of such goods, the market supply of public
        goods will often be less than the economically efficient
        quantity.
-   Entrepreneurs in markets have an incentive to find solutions to each
    market problem, and new solutions are constantly being discovered.
    But problems remain that can potentially be improved through
    government action.
-   Both markets and government can have problems in achieving the
    efficient allocation of resources. The term market failure describes
    the situation where markets will fail to achieve the conditions
    implied by idealized economic efficiency. But political action may
    also result in outcomes that are inefficient, a situation known as
    government failure.
