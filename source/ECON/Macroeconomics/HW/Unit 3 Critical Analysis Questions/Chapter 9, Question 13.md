How are bond prices related to interest rates? Why are they related?

# Answer

<!-- Interest rates and bonds are inversely related. If the interest rates of a bond go down, then the bond becomes more attractive for buyers. This attraction due to a decrease interest rate of the bond caused the demand of the bond to rise. If the demand of the bond rises, then the price too will rise. The converse is also true. If the interest rates increase, then the bond is less attractive for buyers. The loss of attention in the bond results in less demand and less buying, which then leads to price reduction of the bond. The three reasons that bond prices and interest rates are inversely related are as follows. Firstly, as the price of a bond decreases then, the same amount of money pays for more bonds. Secondly, the interest-rate effect shows that price reduction will help increase purchases. Finally, lower price levels will make local or domestic products less expensive than foreign or imported products. -->

Interest rates and bond prices are **inversely** related.
This is because increased interest rates make previously issued bonds a less attractive proposition for buyers, forcing would-be sellers to reduce the price.
Conversely, a low interest rate makes existing bonds issued at a higher interest rate more attractive, increasing their value.
They are related because the incentives to purchase or sell these bonds is dictated by how good they are compared to the option of buying new bonds.
