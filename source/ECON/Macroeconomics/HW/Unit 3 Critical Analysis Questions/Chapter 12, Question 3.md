Suppose that the government provides each taxpayer with a $\$ 1,000$ tax rebate financed by issuing additional Treasury bonds. Outline alternative views that predict how this fiscal action will influence interest rates, aggregate demand, output, and employment.

# Answer

<!-- If the government provides each taxpayer a $1000 tax rebate financed by issuing additional treasury bonds alternative views suggest that those $1000 per taxpayer are not likely to be spent.  New classical economist believes that the individual taxpayer will recognize that the when the government puts itself into debt one year, the taxes will likely rise the following year. Most economical changes are due to political reasoning rather than concern for the economy or the individuals in the population. Therefore, the taxpaying citizens will be more likely to put the money into savings. This results in less demand for products by the population, resulting in less output. Employment will not rise either as business are as well putting that money into savings rather than paying new employees.  Overall, alternative views would predict that this fiscal action will not help the economy in a recession.  -->

An alternative view states that while the $\$ 1,000$ may be spent by some, many people will recognize that the rebate will be paid for by them eventually through increased taxes.
People will be suspicious of government handouts, and understand that the motivation is almost never out of concern for the economy, but is purely motivated by politics.
Those that realise this will put the funds into savings or investments instead of spending it immediately (baring widespread unemployment or reduction in salaries).
The rebate will then, at best, result in no net increase to aggregate demand.
Businesses will behave in a similar way, savings the money to cover increased costs or decreased demand at a later time.
