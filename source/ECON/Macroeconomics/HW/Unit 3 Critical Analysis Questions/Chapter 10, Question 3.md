What impact would a change that shifts an economy's production possibilities curve outward have on the long-run aggregate supply curve? How have improvements in computer technology affected production possibilities and the long-run aggregate supply curve? Explain.

# Answer

<!-- A long run change in aggregate supply indicates that it is possible to sustain a longer rate of output. Improvement in technology increases long run aggregate supply. Improvements in technology will expand the economy’s productive capacity, resulting in the long run aggregate supply shifting towards the right. As the economy’s product possibilities curve has and outward shift, the long aggregate supply curve will increase because improvements in technology enables companies to create more or new products at a lower price. -->

Improvements in computer technology have shifted the production possibilities curve outwards over time because more time can be spent on other work while computers take over certain tasks that used to be done by humans.
This allows for a larger amount of work to be done, as well as increasing the level at which most people work (in terms of theory vs. manual work).
An improvement in technology will shift the aggregate supply curve to the right also, as more goods can be produced for the same amount of time, money, effort, and resources.
