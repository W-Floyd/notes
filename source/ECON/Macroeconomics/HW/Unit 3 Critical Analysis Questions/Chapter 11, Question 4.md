What is a budget deficit? How are budget deficits financed? Why do Keynesians believe that budget deficits will increase aggregate demand?

# Answer

<!-- A budget deficit is when total government spending is greater than the total government revenue. The changes in budget deficit often indicate the state of fiscal policy. The budget deficits are financed by issuing interest-bearing bonds that become the national debt. They do this to borrow funds to finance all their spending. They Keynesians believe that the budget deficits will increase aggregate demand because an increase in government purchases, the spending, will increase the demand for the goods purchased. Therefore, the aggregate demand will rise.  -->

A budget deficit is what occurs when government spending is greater than government revenue.
It is financed by issuing bonds, which become a part of the national debt.
Keynesians believe that a budget deficit will increase aggregate demand because increased government spending will stimulate industries that rely on this business.
Additionally, decreased taxes will likely increase the budget deficit, but similarly increase consumption by consumers, and incentivize businesses further, fueling the economy also.
