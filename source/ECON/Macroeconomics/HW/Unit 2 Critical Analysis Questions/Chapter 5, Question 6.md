English philosopher John Locke argued that the protection of each
individual's person and property (acquired without the use of violence,
theft, or fraud) was the primary function of government. Why is this
protection important to the efficient operation of an economy?

# Answer

This protection is important to the efficient operation of an economy
because it allows business to be conducted without fear of retribution
or interference. When these guarantees can not be made, business cannot
be done efficiently, as there is a much greater risk of negative
repercussions.

For example, in Papua New Guinea, where I grew up, the government does
not effectively protect individuals, much less businesses. Given the
cultural values, this results in sabotage of legitimate and trustworthy
people out of spite (burn down their store because they were doing well
and you're jealous, etc.). If guarantees were made by the government to
appropriately punish those that cause damage and loss of property,
businesses would be much more inclined to invest into the country, which
would be to the benefit of all citizens.

Should government achieve this goal, it stands to benefit from the
increased tax revenue, as will the population that has more affordable
goods and services, as well as more steadier employment.
