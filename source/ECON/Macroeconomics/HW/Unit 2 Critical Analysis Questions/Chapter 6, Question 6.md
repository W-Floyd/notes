"The average person is more likely to make a well-informed choice when
purchasing a personal computer than when voting for a congressional
candidate." Is this statement true? Why or why not?

# Answer

I believe this is true for a number of reasons.

The first reason I believe is because the consumer has a personal
interest and attachment to the good being purchased. They may do
research and collect hard fact and specifications, as well as read
reviews from others that have the same product. Past models of the
product from the same vendor may also be referenced to verify the likely
quality of the item.

In contrast, a congressional candidate is not a standardized product but
a unique "service", filled by a unique person, for a unique period of
time and set of circumstances. There can be made no real guarantees
concerning performance, without electing a new congressional candidate.
For the consumer, there is no way to determine the future suitability of
the candidate, only base it on prior performance in prior positions. The
impersonal aspect of the interaction - coupled with a lack of personal
investment - results in a sense of apathy from the consumer. There is no
immediate payoff for the research into the decision, and little chance
that the decision will materially impact them anyway.
