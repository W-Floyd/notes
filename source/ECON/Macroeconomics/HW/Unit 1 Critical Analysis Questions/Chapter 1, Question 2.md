"The government should provide such goods as health care, education, and
highways because it can provide them for free." Is this statement true
or false? Explain your answer.

# Answer

This statement is false. The government cannot provide these services
for "free", it can only allocate funding towards it - funding that was
secured through taxation of the people these services are provided for.
Short of a dictatorial government, workers must still be paid to
complete these actions and resources must be paid for. There is no such
thing as "free" - at least, not for *somebody*. Whether it is time,
money, services, thought, or material goods, somebody must sacrifice
something for anything else to occur. Governments ought to provide these
services for their citizens because it is something that they are
uniquely equipped to - and are obligated to do. With the incentive to
keep citizens happy in order to continue taxation, governments stand to
gain by providing these services - it makes life better for everyone,
and lets those in power continue to exercise their leadership and
authority. So while governments should indeed provide health care,
education, and highways for "free", it is not "free" to provide. Those
that use these services are paying for them indirectly, through taxation
- whether or not these services are all worthwhile is debateable, but to
have none of them would result in a collapse of society.
