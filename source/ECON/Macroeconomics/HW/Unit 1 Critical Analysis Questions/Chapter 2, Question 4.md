"People in business get ahead by exploiting the needs of their
consumers. The gains of business are at the expense of suffering imposed
on their customers." Evaluate this statement

# Answer

This statement is false. Take, for example, a doctor. They most likely
love their job, and want to help to see people be healthy and happy, but
they also need to be paid for their work. If a doctor does not treat a
patient, letting them suffer, they are at the same time preventing the
patient from "suffering" the "pain" of spending their money - money a
patient perhaps would wish to spend on such a thing. Business is not
evil in itself, it is how the world is able to progress. Without a means
of compensating people for their time, effort, and ability, there is no
way that problems would be solved - it takes more than the good will of
one person to make great things happen. That is not to say that all
businesses are upstanding operations that do not profit from their
consumer's sufferings (even some doctors may do this!), but the trend
will be towards benevolent intent. Many products are not so important as
to constitute "suffering" if they are neglected, and so a business
charging a fee for the product does not in itself make the consumer
suffer.
