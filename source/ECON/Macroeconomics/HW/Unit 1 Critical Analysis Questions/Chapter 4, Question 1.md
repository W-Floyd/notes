How will a substantial increase in demand for housing affect the wages
and employment of carpenters, plumbers, and electricians?

# Answer

A substantial increase in demand for these products will result in an
increase in wage and/or employment of carpenters, plumbers, and
electricians. The tradespeople will take more work if competition is
stiff, or may charge more if there is far more demand that production
capacity. This will in turn decrease demand, typically until production
once again meets demand. If the tradespeople found employment scarce
prior to the demand increase, then employment will be abundant, as there
is unfulfilled demand that is yet to be met. If it does not exceed the
total availability of workers, then the wage will likely not change
significantly. If workers were already in short supply, then the wages
will simply increase in order to capitalize on the market conditions -
taking extra work is unlikely if there was already an abundance of
opportunities. The long term effects of this would be a balancing of
wages and production capacity, where workers will not enter the field if
the potential wage and working conditions are significantly worse than
other job options.
