What are some of the practical problems that limit the effective use of discretionary monetary and fiscal policy as stabilization tools?

# Answer

The correct timing of monetary and fiscal policies is critical to stabilizing the economy. One issue with using policy as a stabilization tool is the lag between implementation and the desired results - recognition lag is the months required to identify recession or inflation, while administrative lag is delay after recognition due to bureaucratic processes. Eventually, once the new policies are put into place, there is an impact lag - that is, the time until a recognizable effect is found on the demand, output, and employment. Forecasting economic conditions is very difficult, as unexpected events can disrupt the norm.
For example, there is a global shortage of computer components, not because of reduced production due to COVID, but increased demand due to the pandemic.
Even going into what was a rather predictable season of lockdown situations, the production capacity for these chip fabs cannot expand fast enough to cater to the increased demand, thus raising the price for certain goods that rely on these components.
