## Acquisition

Start with a range of uncertainty about $\tau_d$, $\tau_c$, $f_d$, $\theta$.

Search over a grid of time and frequency to find the time-frequency with the strongest correlation

1) How fine does the grid need to be in terms of:
   1) time?
   2) frequency?
2) How long do we need to integrate/correlate for a given signal strength?
3) How do 1) and 2) relate?
