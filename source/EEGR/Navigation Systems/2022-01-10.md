Groves - Has done work on GPS in dense urban environments.

For example, using absence of signal in downtown to know which satellites are occluded so you can get a better position estimate from the absence of signal.

# What is Navigation?

1. **Positioning**: Determining a numerical estimate of a position with respect to some frame of reference. This is primarily what this class will be talking about. **We'll do this**
2. **Guidance**: Methods to plan a path or *trajectory* from an initial position to a final position, "path planning", important to robotics.
3. **Tracking**: Estimation of position/velocity of a target *over time*.
   1. **Data Association**: For example, which radar return corresponds to which object. Differentiating between objects.
4. **Mapping**: Defining the position of identifiable landmarks with respect to a reference frame.
5. **Attitude Determination**: Estimating the orientation of one body with respect to another. **We'll do this**

# Types of Navigation

## Dead Reckoning

Tracking change in position/orientation over time !wrt some starting point.

**Accumulate Error**

Inertial Navigation

- Specific Force
- Angular Rate/Change

Is fundamentally a dead reckoning type of system.

## Position Fixing

Estimating position/orientation !wrt a reference frame at a moment in time.
May be combined with dead reckoning to reduce intermediate errors.

### Triangulation

**GPS/GNSS**

*WGS-84 datum* - Mean sea level, gravitational vertical, gravitational equipotential lines.

## Fusion

Combine dead reckoning with position fixing or even partial position fixing to refine position over time (Extended Kalman Filter).
Even if you don't have enough measurements to fully define your position, you can still refine it using one or two measurements.

What are some reference frames?

Earth Centered Earth Fixed
Earth Centered Inertial
North-East-Down
Refueling Tanker, Aircraft Carrier, 

# Inertial Frame of Reference

Not accelerating and not rotating.

Rotating mass gyroscopes don't want to change direction/rotation.
