# GNSS - Global Navigation Satellite System

## GPS - Global Positioning System

* Global
* United States of America

## GLONASS - Global Navigation Satellite System

* Global
* U.S.S.R, Russian Federation

## Galileo

* Global
* European Union

## BeiDou

* To be global, currently regional
* Chinese

# RNSS - Regional Navigation Satellite System

## IRNS

* India
* 5 geostationary satellites + 2 kinda

## QZSS - Quazi-Zenith Satellite System

* Japan
* Japan is not ideal for geostationary satellites, so they use an orbit that has a long dwell time near/over Japan (more than the rest of the orbit).

# SBAS - Space Based Augmentation Systems

Idea is that these correct for sources of error, especially ionospheric.
THey provide differential corrections at continent scale.

## WAAS - Wide-Area Augmentation System

* USA

## EGNOS - European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service

* European Union

# Multilateration

Basic idea behind all communications systems is starting with a carrier:

$$
\cos( 2\pi f_c t)
$$

We modulate it in a particular way.
You can change amplitude, and you can change phase.

$$
A_i (t) \cos(2 \pi f_c t) + A_q (t) \sin(2\pi f_c t)
$$

Basic GPS signal (L1 C/A - Coarse Acquisition) does this how?

## L1 C/A

* BPSK - Binary Phase Shift Keying - $A_i (t) = \pm 1$
* Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum - Pseudo Random Number (PRN) to modulate the signal

1) Mutually orthogonal
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{length} p_i (k) p_i (k-m) \approx 0 \rightarrow
$$

CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access

2) Auto-Correlation
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{length} p_i (k) \cdot p_i (k-m) = \left\{ \begin{matrix}m=0 \rightarrow \text{length of code}\\ m\neq 0 \rightarrow \approx 0 \left\{\begin{matrix}0\\ 1\\ -2\end{matrix}\right. \end{matrix} \right. \rightarrow \text{Enables determining the} t_{tx}
