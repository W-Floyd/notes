Where are you from Sereena? What are you studying here?

-   family is from India
-   grew up as expat in Ndola, Zambia
    -   dad is engineer there
-   degree and year

How on earth did you end up at LETU? There's a story to that isn't
there?

-   God put engineering on my heart a few months before coming to LETU
    -   had been looking at studying in the UK or Canada
    -   Most US deadlines already closed
-   God brought LETU into picture through close church friend
-   Story of application and prayer
    -   while waiting for news, still unsure, so began praying for
        apparance
    -   afterwards, the doors kept opening to come here
-   difficult circumstances up until day of departure, yet God brought
    me through safely

How has God been at work in your life at LETU?

-   tbh, had weak relationship with God before LETU
    -   first clear calling was to come here
-   much more personal relationship with God since you've come here
    -   see it lived around you
    -   had attended a secular school
    -   amazing to see it lived out
-   been given opportunities to learn and grow so much
    -   main one being chance to work with international students
        -   love being able to help as I was helped with my culture
            shock
-   also given deeper understanding of integration of faith and work
    -   before, viewed these as entirely separate
