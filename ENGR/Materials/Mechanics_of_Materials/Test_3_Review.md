### Notes:

SOS 3 (testimony, faith/professional/family journey, statics lesson & app, Q&A)

Set stage

Pick one student and ask the “DNA” questions (what brought you to BJU, highlight of journey to date, where you see dream future, one of your passions outside of BJU)

Now if you asked that about me…(show SMACK pic…this was when I was you but on AC PRO, and tell story of how God did WAY more than I could’ve imagined if I were told that future would happen when I was beginning the journey (start with salvation and “set tone” for miracles ahead which laid “stones” down through career) or show the intro slide from Hanscom Ldrshp Symp)

Couple engineering lessons learned (Henry Morris/Genesis Record about God as original engineer—establishing nuclear, gravitational, and electromagnetic forces and waves in motion at creation; AMRAAM in dirt, vortex ring state, line clearance issue; “Christian” eng lessons—pic of Josh & I on construction mission trip)

Family lesson learned (work/life blender; sharing the journey lessons)

Each lesson drove me further to knees and increasing dependence on Him

Trust in the Lord with all your heart…

With man this impossible, but not with God. All things are possible with God.

Off stage

These were just a couple e.g.’s of stones laid down; in fact, if I had been told what was going to happen in terms of work, family, friends, church, etc, it would have been to fantastic to believe; yet even more happened)

The same is true for you if you keep your eyes on Him, thanking and trusting Him along way…

“Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, 21 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen” Eph 3:20-21
